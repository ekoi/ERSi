<###46947###>Enhanced Tashelhiyt Dictionary: Five Enhanced Dictionary Entries The Netherlands Institute of Advanced Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences (NIAS) has been awarded a SURFoundation grant to produce an "Enhanced Publication" in collaboration with Data Archiving and Network Services (DANS). NIAS selected the Tashelhiyt-Berber Dictionary project of Professor Harry Stroomer (Leiden University, The Netherlands) for this award. Professor Stroomer works at the finalisation of a extensive dictionary of this language of which he will publish a traditional paper version. The aim of the grant is to build an internet prototype of enhanced selected parts of this dictionary. 

This dataset is meant to be a pilot project aiming to see how such an inclusion of digital data works technically and to see whether the resulting enriched entries really improve the understanding of the cultural concepts involved.
<###47364###>Thematic collection: Datasets of Wageningen UR research (WUR) ‘To explore the potential of nature to improve the quality of life’. That is the mission of Wageningen UR (University & Research centre). A staff of 6,500 and 10,000 students from over 100 countries work everywhere around the world in the domain of healthy food and living environment for governments and the business community-at-large.

The strength of Wageningen UR lies in its ability to join the forces of specialised research institutes, Wageningen University and Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences. It also lies in the combined efforts of the various fields of natural and social sciences. This union of expertise leads to scientific breakthroughs that can quickly be put into practice and be incorporated into education. This is the Wageningen Approach.

The domain of Wageningen UR consists of three related core areas:

    - Food and food production
    - Living environment
    - Health, lifestyle and livelihood

Wageningen UR has branches all over The Netherlands (and in China and Brazil, by the way). A large number of lecturers, researchers and other employees are based at Wageningen Campus.

<###47571###>Interview project: Croatian Memories (CroMe) - Unveiling personal memories on war and detention Croatian Memories (CroMe) - Unveiling personal memories on war and detention.

In this project citizens of Croatia from all social layers and regions are interviewed about their personal experiences in violent situations. The project is covering three timeframes: WWII, the Yugoslav period and the war of the 90ies. The overall objective is the stimulation and empowerment of the social and individual processes of "dealing with the past" in order to improve mutual understanding in Croatia and adjacent regions.

In creating a platform where general public as well as professionals can find information about remembrance of the past told by individuals in a balanced representation of the people currently living in Croatia, this process can take place in the next years or decades.


The interviews are held in Croatian. A transcription in Croatian, and a translation in English is added to the audiovisual file.

The interviews are for scholarly use only. Parts of the interviews can be found on the Croation Memories website, these are freely accessible.
<###47661###>Decline of the Corporate Community. Network Dynamics of the Dutch Business Elite From its inception, big business in the western industrialised world has been organised in national business communities. Central elements of these business communities are corporate board interlocks that constitute the notorious ‘Old Boys Network’. This corporate elite connects the centres of corporate governance. 

This project investigates how the decline of the old boys network in the Netherlands has affected Dutch capitalism. Combining formal network analysis with insights from interviews with key corporate elite members, the project shows how during the last quarter of the 20th century the Dutch business community has disappeared. This is interpreted as a drift towards a liberal market economy. However, as the study shows, even in a liberal market economy corporate directors need social networks to communicate and coordinate their strategic decisions. Hence, the corporate elite shift its meeting network to private
and informal circles.

The dataset contains the board composition of the largest 250 firms in the Netherlands, 1976, 1996 and 2001, the board interlocks between firms, and the meetings between directors.

<###2340###>Stone artefact production and exchange among the northern Lesser Antilles This work discusses the exchange of stone materials and artefacts among the northern Lesser Antilles during the Ceramic Age (500 BC - AD 1492). Through the systematic analysis of source materials and a comparison of these with lithic artefacts, the provenance of a significant portion of stone material found at a number of prehistoric Amerindian habitation sites located on different islands from Puerto Rico to Martinique was determined. Following this the distribution of three specific materials, including a variety of flint from Long Island, Antigua, a grey-green mudstone and a multi-coloured conglomerate, both form St. Martin, were specified. These distribution patterns along with data on the production of the artefacts were used to determine the mode of exchange that was responsible for their spread. From these data it appeared that inter-island exchange was a recurrent feature among Amerindian society in the Caribbean throughout the entire Ceramic Age. Furthermore the differences in distributions through time could be related to changes in socio-political organisation within the region and supported the notion of increasing competition within society.

This description comprises the third wave of the longitudinal mobility survey ( longitudinaal verplaatsingsonderzoek ). Subsequent waves will be stored under different study numbers. The survey monitors ( changes in ) transportational behaviour, mobility and effects of raising tariffs for public transportation. Data were gathered by questionnaire and diaries, describing all mobility during one week. Detailed data were gathered on: family composition, financial situation of family, working hours, commuting, travelling allowances, car, train, use of reduced fare cards for public transport. This wave consists of seven files, containing family-data( A=SPSS-file, D=raw data ), family member-data ( B=SPSS-file, E=raw data ), transfer-data( C=raw data ), week-matrices ( F=raw data ) and commuting data ( G=raw data ) respectively.

<###3000###>Ground-taxes of Strijen, 18th century The dataset contains the transcription of the 'Quohieren van Verpondingen' (assessment lists of ground-taxes) from the eighteenth century of the village Strijen in the district 'Hoeksche Waard' in the Netherlands. Data on rent and ground-taxes on real estate in Strijen are included. On occasion of the millennium anniversary of Strijen, the journal 'Ons Voorgeslacht' devoted a special issue to Strijen (volume 50, nr 462, 1995). The lists were published in this special issue.  The original purpose of the dataset attempted to trace which person has lived in which house by making a comparison between two (source) lists. In spite of the fact that the rank order of the houses is mostly equal, it is not so easy to get a balanced conclusion on the exact history of inhabitation. Sometimes the period between the two lists is 20 years, so that changes of the ownership of a house sometimes are not noticed.

<###4448###>Pre-Columbian social organisation and interaction interpreted through the study of settlement patterns The archaeological study, investigating pre-Columbian social organisation and interaction on Pointe des Châteaux, La Désirade and Petite Terre (Guadeloupe, F.W.I.), is based on an intensive, systematic inventory through surface observations for the complete research area instead of using excavation data from settlements only, as is common in Caribbean archaeology. This resulted in an extended site catalogue and insight in the local occupation history until the arrival of Europeans. The earliest occupational evidence dates from AD 400. People lived in coastal settlements and ate tubers, (shell)fish, land animals, birds, fruits and seeds. The food economy hardly changed hereafter. Long distance contacts, reaching the South-American mainland, existed. After AD 600/850 the number of villages increased and special locations for ceremonial and other activities were established. Many villages were coastal, some were inland. One village assumed a central role. Long distance contacts (reaching the mainland and the Greater Antilles) continued to exist. Intensive short distance contacts first appear. From AD 1200/1300 population decreased, probably as result of developing complex societies on the Greater Antilles. People lived on high elevations. Long distance contacts and local networks continued to exist. After the end of the 15th century, the research area was no longer inhabited by Amerindians.

The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) at the VU University and VU University Medical Centre is initiated by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports in 1991 to determine predictors and consequences of ageing. LASA focuses on physical, emotional, cognitive and social functioning in late life, the connections between these aspects, and the changes that occur in the course of time.      
It concerns a cross-sequential longitudinal study, with a multidisciplinary approach, a sample in 3 regions, initial ages of respondents 55-85. Number of cases: N = 3,107 (1992) and N=1,002 (2002), and number of variables: over 10,000.

<###24935###>Vignette Experiment on Paradata (LISS Core Study) This study consists of two measures. In July 2008, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire on how the panel members feel about privacy in general; about the extent to which they feel that their privacy is violated by various organizations; and about their trust in research institutes. This questionnaire was fielded ahead of an experiment on the collection of paradata.             
             
In August 2008, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire on the collection of paradata. The panel members were presented a fictitious invitation to participate in a study, after which they were asked to indicate the probability of their participation. Depending on the condition to which panel members were assigned, the type of research institute that issued the invitation, the topic of the study, and the extent to which the invitation mentioned the collection of so-called paradata (the recording of data pertaining to e.g. browser features, user's behavior, keystrokes, time indications, and so on) all varied.

<###25020###>Effect of perceived social distributions on subjective well-being (LISS Core Study) In this study, we focus on factors underlying the concept of well-being, in particular the extent to which well-being is affected by social comparison processes. Previous studies have looked at how well-being can be predicted by people’s relative position, for instance with respect to income or health, within an objectively defined population distribution. It may be that people’s well-being might be better predicted by the subjective, rather than by the objective distributions of properties such as income or health. We intend to investigate this.          
          
In July 2008, the first part of the questionnaire about subjective estimations of properties such as income, health, number of friends et cetera was administered to het LISS panel.          
          
In October 2008 the second part of the study was administered, in which data were used from part 1. This second part of the study investigates factors underlying the concept of well-being, in particular the extent to which well-being is affected by social comparison processes. Previous studies have looked at how well-being can be predicted by people’s relative position, for instance with respect to income or health, within an objectively defined population distribution. It may be that people’s well-being might be better predicted by the subjective, rather than by the objective distributions of properties such as income or health.
<###25038###>Disease Prevention (LISS Core Study) The study focuses on health behavior and disease probabilities.                 
                 
In September 2008, a questionnaire on preventive care and the value of risk reduction was administered to the LISS panel. Panel members were asked about their participation in preventive care programs available in the Netherlands (flu shots, cervical cancer tests, mammograms, STD tests and the use of aspirin for the prevention of heart disease). In addition, they were asked about their previous experience with the disease and prevention, whether they were invited to participate in the free program, the motivations behind their participation decision, the actual or expected costs of the intervention, risk factors that might influence their individual risk of disease, and their perceptions of the risks they face with and without preventive care. Panel members were asked a number of subjective probability questions, including the risk of developing a particular disease and the risk of mortality. The questionnaire also had an experiment to investigate the role of framing. Some people were asked about the probability of survival and others were asked about the probability of death. Also the order of the subjective probability questions was randomized. Finally, visual aids were used to help people to interpret and express small probabilities: One third of the respondents answered the probability questions in a normal answer box, one third received a digital scale to provide their answer, and one third was presented a number-line with a magnifier, making it easier to choose very small probabilities.                  
                 
In Januari 2009, a question was asked in the LISS panel about the flu shot and in April 2009, a question about the flu itself.

<###25472###>Report on the arthropod remains from two Bronze Age samples from Rodenkirchen-Hahnenknooper Mühle, Germany This report presents the results of the study of remains of invertebrate animals found in the samples 2711 and 2857 taken from within and outside the Bronze Age farmhouse excavated at Rodenkirchen Hahnenknooper Mühle, Germany. Validation of the samples had already demonstrated that both samples yielded sufficient arthropod remains for a more thorough analysis. For a description of the samples and the extraction method used I would like to refer to the relevant sections in the validation report (Scarab-report 051).
<###25497###>The mites (Acari) from the section below Sugarloaf Hill The samples from which the mite remains have been extracted were all taken from the Late-glacial deposits at the section 'Below Sugarloaf Hill'. The oldest sample (A) was dated to c. 13,000 BP and was taken from a moss layer within the earliest Holocene deposits at the site. An environmental reconstruction was made on the basis of these samples.
<###25491###>Report on the arthropod remains in four samples from the Gent rubbish dump In this report the results of a study of arthropod remains found in four samples from only a few decades old are presented. The methods of extraction and interpretation used are those developed for the study of archaeological arthropod remains. A total of four samples from the rubbish dump was studied to analyse the arthropod remains. The samples were taken from deposits which could roughly be dated to the 1950’s, the 1960’s, the early 1970’s and the late 1970’s and they varied in size between nearly 700 grammes and almost one and a half kilogram.
<###25519###>Validation-report on the arthropod remains from five Bronze Age samples from Rodenkirchen-Hahnenknooper Mühle, Germany The arthropod study on the material from Rodenkirchen-Hahnenknooper Mühle presented in this report is a typical assessment aimed at the selection of one or more samples for a detailed analysis focussing on the excrement deposits found in and around the farmhouse. A total of 5 samples from dung deposits was initially studied to assess the potential of the arthropod remains.
<###25538###>The mite remains from Deer Park Farms 87, sample 1046/5 and Lloyds Bank 72/73, sample 16 The mitefauna from Deer Park Farm are too `dirty' for a regular archaeological fill of a pit, ditch or well but it does not show the characteristics of a fauna found in places used to dump excrements such as latrines, cess-pits or a sunken-byre. As yet no solid interpretation could be given. The interpretation of the sample from Lloyds Bank is relatively straightforward; the deposit must have consisted largely of animal excrements, probably horse dung.
<###25534###>Validation-report on the arthropod remains from three Merovingian samples from Tournai, Belgium The arthropod study presented in this report is a typical assesment of a sample to ascertain the value of the soil samples for analysis of the arthropod remains. A total of three samples taken from the dark earth layer was initially studied to assess the potential of the arthropod remains.

<###31799###>Case studies in archaeological predictive modelling In this thesis, a collection of papers is put together dealing with various quantitative aspects of predictive modelling and archaeological prospection. Among the issues covered are the effects of survey bias on the archaeological data used for predictive modelling, and the complexities of testing predictive models using both old and new archaeological data. Furthermore, an attempt is made to reconcile the worlds of expert judgment and quantitative analysis by means of multicriteria decision making techniques and Bayesian statistics. The thesis also offers some alternative approaches to predictive modelling, like using prehistoric land use reconstructions, and the integrating of social and cultural factors into the models. It also giv es an up to date review of the international and Dutch state of affairs in archaeological predictive modeling.

<###31860###>Neolithic Depositions in the Northern Netherlands As early as the 19th century discoveries of groups of large axes puzzled those confronted with them. The fact that most were found in waterlogged places in particular formed the basis of speculation as to the nature of these objects. In this Research Master thesis, the character and significance of TRB flint axe depositions are explored. The first part of this thesis is mainly concerned with the question how selective deposition was structured. By means of metrical, spatial and functional analysis, patterns are explored that can shed light on the actions performed by people in the past. The second part of the thesis deals with the meaning and significance of TRB flint axe depositions. Why did people in the past do the things they did, how were these actions meaningful and important? Using sociological theory and ethnographic evidence an interpretation is presented based on the empirically observed patterns.

<###32132###>Individual freedom of choice in the field of social insurance - KSV 2001 This study examines: 1) the public's view on a number of hypothetical schemes, in which they may opt for greater freedom of choice in social insurance. This can be seen as a measure of the support for a number of new arrangements offering choice in the area of disability benefits, unemployment benefit and sickness benefit, and also in relation to the various forms of paid leave (parental leave, study leave, informal care leave); 2) whether respondents feel that they themselves would make use of the proposed schemes, and to what extent this behavioural intention depends on the financial consequences; 3) whether the support for and potential take-up of new schemes derive from urgent needs shared by a large section of the population, or whether other factors, such as rational choices, considerations of principle, stable value systems and personal characteristics, are responsible.   The determinants were studied on the basis of the subjective motives put forward by the respondents when measuring the level of support, as well as a large number of other characteristics about which data were collected in the survey because of their potential for providing a theoretical explanation. A need for greater freedom of choice is indicated here by specific subjective motives cited by the respondents, and by background characteristics such as family composition, age, income and health status.

<###32258###>Social networks and intergroup conflict 2000 Conflicts between groups are among the most challenging problems of mankind. They arise as groups compete for the possession of certain scarce resources. Under what conditions does such competition lead to conflict or to a peaceful coexistence? Why do individual group members, despite the likelihood of being harmed, voluntarily become involved in conflicts? Social Networks and Intergroup Conflict explores how decisions of individuals in competitive intergroup relations are influenced by their social network and by a common past and future. Social network effects are studied with a specific focus on the segregation effect. It is shown how these effects arise from individual actions that are constrained by social control which takes place in the individuals network neighborhood. The study reveals conditions under which social control has positive or negative effects on individual participation in conflict. It shows the mechanisms through which social control operates and affects intergroup relations. In repeated interactions it is analyzed how and to what extent individuals apply behavioral heuristics that are driven by past experience or are based on future expectations. This study examines these questions using analytical, computer simulation and experimental tools in order to promote methods of conflict resolution.

<###32531###>European and World Value Surveys Integrated Data File, 1999-2002, Release 1 - ICPSR 3975 The series is designed to enable a cross-national, cross-cultural comparison of values and norms on a wide variety of topics and to monitor changes in values and attitudes across the globe. This data collection, representing the fourth wave of surveys carried out by the World Values Survey (WVS) and European Values Survey (EVS) groups, covers 60 countries, with high priority given to obtaining coverage of Islamic societies and African societies, which have rarely been included in cross-national survey research. These surveys cover a broader range of variation than has before been available for analyzing the belief systems of mass publics. They provide data from representative national samples of the publics of 81 societies containing 85 percent of the world's population and covering a full range of variation, from societies with per capita incomes below 300 dollars per year, to societies with per capita incomes of more than 35,000 dollars per year, from long-established democracies to authoritarian states, and from societies with market economies to societies that are in the process of emerging from state-run economies. The surveys cover societies that were historically shaped by a wide variety of religious and cultural traditions, from Christian to Islamic to Confucian to Hindu, and from societies whose culture emphasizes social conformity and group obligations, to societies in which the main emphasis is on human emancipation and self-expression. Broad topics covered in the 1999-2002 waves were work, personal finances, the economy, politics, allocation of resources, contemporary social issues, technology and its impact on society, and traditional values. Respondents were asked whether the following acts were ever justifiable: suicide, cheating on taxes, lying, euthanasia, divorce, and abortion. Respondents were also asked about the groups and associations they belonged to, which ones they worked for voluntarily, the groups they would not want as neighbors, their general state of health, and whether they felt they had free choice and control over their lives. A wide range of items was included on the meaning and purpose of life, such as respondents' views on the value of scientific advances, the demarcation of good and evil, and religious behavior and beliefs. Respondents were also queried about their attitudes toward religion, morality, politics, sexual freedom, marriage, single parenting, child-rearing, and the importance of work, family, politics, and religion in their lives. Questions relating to work included what financial and social benefits were most important to them in a job, the pride they took in their work, if they were happy with their current position, and their views on owner/state/employee management of business. Questions pertaining to the stability of the world economy and whether respondents were happy with their financial situation were also asked. Respondents' opinions of various forms of political action, the most important aims for their countries, confidence in various civil and governmental institutions, and whether they would fight in a war for their country were also elicited. Demographic information includes family income, number of people residing in the home, size of locality, region of residence, occupation of the head of household, and the respondent's age, sex, occupation, education, religion, religiosity, political party and union membership, and left-right political self-placement.

<###32958###>Micromacrodataset Suriname 1970 the micro-macro dataset Surinam consists of a number of economic time-series, ranging from 1954-1987, packaged with software for analysis, simulation and model testing. This study consists of the construction of an empirical macro-model of a micro-economy, the small and very open economy of Surinam. the model thereof has been used for the analysis of the economic development of Surinam and the simulation of different development strategies. If one tries to build a model for a small open economy, one is confronted with the problem that the law of large numbers does not work in the export sector. Approximately 90% of exports is furnished by only eleven products. In that situation the development of total export prices, volumes, and investments in the export sector, is dominated by accidental factors. they make it difficult to get the underlying economical behaviour relationships in the picture. However, we have solved this problem by building a micro-block for the export sector, which consists of special price, production and investment functions for every of the eleven main export products. Thanks to the method of the micro-block it appeared not only feasible to incorporate the export sector of a small open economy in an empirical macro-model, but it also offers the opportunity to build a bridge across the river, which divides business-economics and macro-economics. With this model one can study the interaction between costs and prices at the macro-level and the production, economic growth and incomes on the macro-level. In the model the "parallel market" is also incorporated. This market was introduced in 1984/1985 and since that time other import and consumption functions are in force and a double exchange rate is operative. Further the model has a government-block, with semi-behavioural equations for incomes and expenditures of government. For the sake of estimation of the equations of the model this study started with the construction of a consistent dataset over the years 1954 up to 1987. See the special publication "Micromacrodataset" for a detailed description of this statistical activity. In the micromacrodataset is also reported about the book-keeping model "MACROSABC", with which the "Monetary Surveys" and the "National Accounts" are generated. the micromacrodataset together with Macros gives all the micro and macro time series which are needed to estimate the macro-model named "MACMIC". Most equations of MACMIC are estimated separately, but some also simultaneously. Besides that we tested the model by way of historical simulations over different periods: 54-60/ 61-67/ 68-75/ 76-82/ 83-87. the historical simulations consists at the same time of an analysis of the economic development and relations in the Surinamese economy. We also made a base line for the years 1988 up to 2001. Based on a short survey of recent literature on development economics different policies are formulated and simulated with the model. Also some policy-packages are simulated, especially development strategies to restructure the economy. Thanks to the micro-macro character of the model the role of the prices and parallel market can be taken into account explicitly. the preparation of concrete policy proposals is beyond the scope of this theoretical study. However, the model and data are also available on diskettes (see Micromacrodataset). This gives the opportunity to take cognizance of the results of this study in a more intensive way, and to use the model for own analysis and simulations. the dataset is available for work on further improvement for the modelling of Surinam's economy. In the Micromacrodataset and diskettes, which are published together with this study, one can find a basic for a generalisation of our data handling software and model. It has already been used for the fantasy island "Microland".

<###33051###>Innovatie Project Amsterdam 1971-1978 The Innovation Project Amsterdam ( IPA ) was a large scale educational  project. The longitudinal project, which lasted from 1971 until 1978,  was realised as a cooperation between Amsterdam primary schools, the Advice  and Guidance Centre for Education in Amsterdam ( ABC ) and the Research	Institute for Applied Psychology of the University of Amsterdam. It's aim was to improve the educational facilities for working-class children  in the old districts of Amsterdam, by establishing - among other things -  close relationships between school, family and neighbourhood.  Based on then popular principles of action-research, the research staff of  the project was strongly involved with the actual changes in the field.	The project started with some 15 schools and covered some 40 during it's  existence. The project yielded many hundreds of raw data-files, some on punched cards  and some on magnetic tape. Most of these files contained the results	of educational tests and were poorly documented when transferred to the  Steinmetz archive. The amount of material and the state it was in, left  the archive no other choice than to "keep as is", which in turn has led  to serious losses over time, due to deterioration of tapes and cards.

Broad topics covered are work, the meaning and purpose of life, family life, and contemporary social issues. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of work, family, friends, leisure time, politics, and religion in their lives. They were also asked how satisfied they were with their present lives, whether they tended to persuade others close to them, whether they discussed political matters, and how they viewed society. Questions relating to work included what aspects were important to them in a job, the pride they took in their work, their satisfaction with the present job, and their views on owner/state/employee management of business. Respondents were asked about the groups and associations they belonged to and which ones they worked for voluntarily, the level of trust they had in most people, the groups they would not want as neighbours, their general state of health, and whether they felt they had free choice and control over their lives. A wide range of items was included on the meaning and purpose of life, such as respondents' views on the value of scientific advances, the demarcation of good and evil, and religious behaviour and beliefs. Respondents were queried about whether they shared the same attitudes toward religion, morality, politics, and sexual mores with their partner and parents, their views on marriage and divorce, qualities important for a child to learn, whether a child needs both parents to grow up happy, views on mothers working outside the home, views on abortion, and whether marriage is an outdated institution.

Culturele veranderingen in Nederland 1985 - CV'85
<###33428###>Netherlands Kinship Panel Study - wave 1 - 2002-2004 and  wave 2 - 2006-2007 : A Multi-Actor, Multi-Method Panel Study on Solidarity in Family Relationships The data from the NKPS are freely accessible via the NKPS website to researchers affiliated with academic and (semi-)government organizations. To access the data files researchers must have registered as NKPS data users and have undersigned the NKPS privacy policy. No one has any exclusive right or priority to use the NKPS to work on any research question.      The Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) involves the development of a database that allows the examination of family and kinship in the Netherlands from a dynamic multi-actor perspective. The increasingly complex nature of contemporary family relationships has posed society and policymakers with a series of new and challenging questions, but the lack of institutional and scientific growth in family studies has left this potential unrealized. The scarcity of high-quality databases has affected the competitiveness of Dutch family studies in the international academic community.  The NKPS offers a large-scale panel survey that is accessible to the national and international research community. This study has been explicitly undertaken to provide a data resource for a wide range of researchers.  The NKPS-data are collected from multiple actors, by multiple methods, and at multiple points in time.  - Multi-actor. This implies that the focus is on relationships and networks of relationships rather than on individuals. Data are collected from individual respondents (so-called Anchors) as well as from family members (so-called Survey Alters). Survey Alters are: the partner, a maximum of two children aged 15 and over, father/mother, and a brother/sister aged 15 and over. Survey Alters do not necessarily co-reside with the Anchor.  - Multi-method. A large-scale survey with pre-structured questions is complemented with in-depth studies (mini-panels) using flexible interview schedules. In the survey, the data are collected by means of face-to-face interviews and self-completion questionnaires.  - Panel. Relationships are in constant flux. The NKPS is a panel study in order to understand the dynamic nature of family solidarity and to study causes and effects of solidarity within family relationships. The waves will be spaced three years apart.   The first central component of the NKPS is the emphasis on the nature and degree of solidarity within family relationships. Solidarity is defined as `feelings of mutual connectedness in family relationships and how these are expressed in behavioral terms¿. Three dimensions are distinguished: instrumental, social and emotional solidarity. The second central component is the focus on family relationships in a broad sense, instead of just relationships within the nuclear family.  The data are from two samples from the Dutch population. The first (the main sample) is a random sample of individuals within private households in the Netherlands, with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum age of 79. The second (the migrant sample) is a stratified random sample of members of the four largest migrant groups in the Netherlands: Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Dutch Antilleans. The NKPS collaborated with the Social Position and Use of Welfare Provisions by Migrants survey for the collection of data among the migrants.  Different data collection forms were used in the NKPS main study. To collect data from Anchors, we used Computer Aided Personal Interviewing (CAPI), supplemented with self-completion questionnaires. To collect data from Survey Alters, we used self-completion questionnaires only. Anchors who had previously refused to participate in the main study or who had not been reached, filled in a substitute questionnaire an ¿abridged, self-completion version of the CAPI questionnaire. The fieldwork of the main study resulted in 9771 interviews or substitute questionnaires.

<###33464###>Native Neighbours The analysis of four native-Roman settlements in Oss has shown that two major changes have taken place since the late Iron Age. Shifting farms were replaced by compound settlements at fixed locations. Within an enclosed spatial area farms were rebuilt on the same location. However, intra-settlement differences in lay-out, size, structure and finds are very obvious too.

<###33531###>Ancient hunters, modern butchers The PhD thesis Ancient Hunters, Modern Butchers presents a first detailed study of bone material found together with spectacularly preserved wooden spears at the Lower Palaeolithic site of Schöningen 13II-4, in Germany. Analysis of a large sample of bone remains from this site revealed data being very relevant to the hunting versus scavenging debate in Palaeolithic archaeology. Excellent conservation of the bone material facilitated a thorough documentation of butchery traces and the reconstruction of early hominid subsistence behaviour at the site. The author argues that Schöningen 13II-4 represents a Lower Palaeolithic kill-butchery site where especially horses have been killed and butchered for multiple animal products. The results of this study seriously question the validity of models on marginal, more scavenging like Lower Palaeolithic hominid subsistence behaviour.

<###33550###>Sowing the seed? Human impact and plant subsistence in Dutch wetlands during the Late Mesolithic and the Early and Middle Neolithic (5500-3400 cal BC). This data set concerns the data generated during a Ph.D. study in the field of Archaeobotany on the neolithisation process in the Dutch wetlands. The study is part of the research project ‘The Malta Harvest: From Hardinxveld to Noordhoorn - from forager to farmer’, described as 'A new specification of Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic culture and society of the Lower Rhine Basin, 6000-3500 cal BC, in their North European context'. The research project has been performed at the Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, and was financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

The archaeobotanical study deposited is primarily a literature study, based on analysis of published information, databases, published and unpublished reports from a variety of institutes and companies, and unpublished data from the Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University. The primary sources are given in the Ph.D. thesis and the included list of references. The archived data include already published data, new data and new overviews of existing data, including identifications of pollen, seeds, waterlogged wood, wood charcoal and additional sources.
<###33564###>SHARE - Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) is a multidisciplinary and cross-national panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks of more than 30,000 individuals aged 50 or over. Eleven countries have contributed data to the 2004 SHARE baseline study. They are a balanced representation of the various regions in Europe, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden) through Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece). Further data have been collected in 2005-06 in Israel. Two 'new' EU member states - the Czech Republic and Poland - as well as Ireland have joined SHARE in 2006 and participated in the second wave of data collection in 2006-07. The survey’s third wave of data collection, SHARELIFE in 2008-09, will collect detailed retrospective life-histories in sixteen countries, with Slovenia joining in as a new member.        
The data are available to the entire research community for no costs via de SHARE website.

<###33699###>Thematische collectie: LISS panel data - overview of available LISS Studies The LISS panel has been founded by the CentERdata research institute in Tilburg, the Netherlands. Since 2007, the nearly 8.000 individuals in the panel complete various online questionnaires each month. Academic researchers can require access to these data at no cost after signing a statement concerning the use of the data.

Furthermore, the LISS panel can be used to collect one's own data. This is also cost-free for researchers at universities and scientific institutes. Researchers from the Netherlands and abroad are free to submit a survey proposal. Proposals can be very brief, can be submitted throughout the year, and will be reviewed within one to three months (see the website for guidelines).

Next to researchers’ own studies, the LISS Core Study is fielded in the panel every year, consisting of several modules on various themes such as work, education, health, family relations, social integration, leisure time, ethnicity, religion, income, assets, political views, values and personality. 
                                                                              
The LISS panel is specifically intended for scientific research. For this reason, the quality and the coverage of the sample is of prime concern. The panel is based on a traditional random sample drawn from the population registers. Persons not included in the original sample cannot participate, so there can be no self-selection. People without a computer or Internet connection are provided with equipment to participate by CentERdata. The quality and representativeness of the panel are monitored jointly with Statistics Netherlands. 

In addition  to the LISS panel  a special immigrant panel is  available.                                                                  
This immigrant panel has been in full operation since October 2010 and is comprised of around 1600 households (2400 individuals) of which 1100 households (1700 individuals) are of non-Dutch origin.                                                                       
                            
The LISSpanel datafiles are archived at DANS, but only acessible via the CentERdata LISS panel website:
<###33749###>Analecta Praehistorica Leidensia 40 In 2003, at the age of 63, Leendert ended his administrative duties after being a dean of the Faculty of Archaeology for 20 years, a Faculty he created and let flourish. He ceased administration and education, but carried on his research on the neolithisation of north-western Europe. The large National Science Foundation grant that he obtained in 2003 for his project From Hardinxveld to Noordhoorn, from forager to farmer was a great reward for his work on the subject.
His knowledge and innovative views made him a respected teacher and colleague who still is one of the leading international figures in the field. This immediately became clear when we send out a call for papers in May 2007. Eventually twenty-three colleagues were able to contribute to this liber amicorum and another twenty to the conference that has been organised in advance of the valedictory address on June 13, 2008.
<###33750###>Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey ( TRAILS ) T1 (Baseline) Population Cohort The overall objective of the study is to contribute to the understanding of the determinants of adolescents’ mental (ill-)health and social development during adolescence and young adulthood, as well as the mechanisms underlying the associations between determinants and these outcomes. A particular aim is to focus on the interplay between individual characteristics and environmental factors. In addition to this major objective, a number of participants investigate the course and determinants of somatic (ill-)health, covering topics such as overweight, lung disease, sports, physical activity, and more.

They are published on the Internet in a format with search capabilities that enables visitors to access the material in a variety of ways. The backbone of this Internet site is formed by an XML-database that includes scholarly editions and indexes.                            
Since most emblematic studies have a comparative aim, indexes and other search tools are incorporated in the editions.

The data set contains information about ethnic distance, inter-ethnic contacts, perceived economic- and cultural threat, personallity, meta-view, and relevant background characteristics of 1.444 pupils at five different levels of education, which are in 77 classes at 10 different schools, and live in 117 different postcode area's.
<###33831###>Analecta Praehistorica Leidensia 39 In the summer of 1991, the Dutch media featured extensively the excavation of an early Bandkeramik (LBK) village in Geleen, Limburg. The headlines in the newspapers read: "7000 years old farmers village", "Oldest village of the Netherlands discovered in Geleen". 
What was the case? The University of Leiden was excavating an almost complete prehistoric village once inhabited by the very first farmers in this part of Europe. If it was not the first village of the Netherlands, then it was at least one of a series
of early villages.

EML is currently in development at the Open University of the Netherlands. It is, therefore, not (yet) a world standard in the field of educational mark-up languages. In order to facilitate a connection to the Emblem Project Utrecht, which has entirely been developed in XML, an experimental approach in EML was chosen.
<###33871###>Voyages of the WIC, 1674-1740 This dataset contains a list of voyages of Dutch WIC-ships. The list is chronologically ordered and contains information regarding the names of the captains, the destinations, the date of departure from the Dutch Republic, the date of arrival and the ship type. 

The Columns ‘special features regarding the cargo’ contains information on the value in Dutch guilders of the Cargo for both the way out and the way back. 

The Column special features holds information on the course of the journey (some ships were wrecked, hijacked or demolished), whether a ship was hired or if it was an interloper

<###33896###>Traced interlopers, 1674-1730 This database contains 85 to 90 percent of the Dutch interlopers between 1674 and 1730. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the word ‘interloper’ (lorrendraaier) generally referred to a smuggler ship, a ship trading goods and slaves out of the monopoly of the West Indian Company. ‘Since interloper activity was illegal, documentation concerning its role is difficult to find, if available at all’ (Postma). About one fifth of the interlopers didn’t fulfil its journey. They were captured by the West Indian Company, were shipwrecked of hijacked by pirates. More on interlopers can be read in the summary of the book ‘Lorrendrayen op Africa’ by Paesie that is added in PDF-format in this database.
<###33898###>Dutch Atlantic connections: the circulation of people, goods and ideas in the Atlantic world, 1600-1795 The database "Dutch Atlantic connections" gives information on 7666 journeys made by Dutch ships in the 17th and 18th centuries. These include ships of the Dutch West India Company, Dutch naval ships returning from the Caribbean, interlopers illegally operating in WIC monopoly territory, private traders sailing to the Caribbean, Africa, Surinam and New Netherland. Most journeys are standard trading ventures, but there are some notable journeys, including Henry Hudson’s journey to North America. 
This is an integrated database containing data from earlier created datasets of the historians prof. dr. H. J. den Heijer, dr. W.W. Klooster, dr. R. Paesie, dr. J. Postma, dr. C. Reinders Folmer – van Prooijen and dr. J. Jacobs. The database contains also a limited number of data from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database.      
The goal of this database is to provide a platform into which information on Dutch Atlantic trade may be integrated. It is hoped that the number of almost 8000 journeys in the database may be expanded with further research.

<###34131###>Database developing world - DDW In the last decades, many large-scale representative household surveys have been conducted in developing countries. In these surveys, for millions of individuals, demographic, socio-economic, health and other information has been collected. At this moment, the data from these surveys cover over 100 countries in all regions of the developing world.           
          
In the Database Developing World (DDW) these datasets are brought together, made comparable, and enriched with contextual data at the subnational and national level. In this way, a unique window to the developing world is created that makes it possible to study important processes taking place there on a scale and with a degree of detail that has never been possible before.           

<###34143###>Nationaal Kiezersonderzoek, NKO 1971-2006 cumulatieve file The main purpose of this data collection was to provide directly accessible information on change and stability of electoral behavior and political orientation in the Netherlands.                                          
This dataset is a compilation of common core variables included in the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies of 1971, 1972, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1989, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2006. However, several of the election studies consist of pre-election interviews as well as post-election interviews.                                           
Hence, the criteria for selecting the waves and variables were:                                           
(1) The waves and variables included in the integrated dataset should be as representative as possible of the Dutch electorate,                                           
(2) If a variable was not available in the first wave of a study, it was taken from the second wave or the third wave,                                           
(3) All variables included at least four times in the 1971-2006 studies were included in the integrated dataset (albeit with some exceptions, documented below), and                                           
(4) If necessary, selected variables were recoded and converted to facilitate longitudinal analyses.                                           
The major areas of study focus on national problems, political efficacy, perceived stand of the main political parties on important political issues, view of religion in society, satisfaction with government, social participation, voting behavior in recent elections, left-right self-rating, left-right rating of political parties, sense of civic competence, civic political participation, legitimacy of social protest and government reaction, political distrust, and political cynicism. Respondents' views on other salient political and social issues, such as abortion, nuclear energy, differences in income, and nuclear armaments, were also elicited.

<###34266###>Heuristics (LISS Core Study) In this study, the influence of verbal, numerical and visual language is tested on a five point scale.         
        
In August 2008, a questionnaire was administered to the LISS panel consisting of five questions measured on a five point scale. In September 2008, there was a follow-up survey with different visual heuristics. The aim of the surveys was to find out if the use of numbers and verbal labels reduces the effect of visual language.
<###34325###>Computerized Mensural Music Editing (CMME) Project A scholarly initiative to offer free online access to new, high-quality early music scores produced by today's leading experts. Based at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the project represents a collaborative development effort of specialists in musicology, information science, and music retrieval. The major purpose of the enterprise is to produce and maintain an online corpus of electronic editions, in addition to software tools making them accessible to students, scholars, performers, and interested amateurs. Here, the brilliant polyphonic styles known to the modern world through the works of such masters as Dufay, Josquin, Machaut, Palestrina, and Tallis can come to life again in the central medium of the 21st century.
<###34333###>Nijmegen School Study  2010 - TNSS 2010 - wave 1 In the Nijmegen School Study (TNSS) data is collected on bullying behavior, friendships, explicit prejudice, implicit prejudice, negative and positive forms of inter-ethnic contact, sexual harassment and gender explicit and implicit bias. The respondents of the first wave (TNSS wave 2010) are first and second year students in all levels of secondary education, within the same school located in a mid size city of the Netherlands. Following the bullying literature, different dimensions of bullying are distinguished (i.e. verbally, socially/relationally, physically and ethnic bullying). The data was collected assisted by computers, due to the nature of the state of the art instruments for measuring implicit biases. Several instruments were used: a main questionnaire and three Implicit Association tests for the student sample and a supplementary questionnaire for the mentors of the classes included in the study.
<###34349###>The Integration of the European Second Generation in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (TIES-NL), 2006-2007. The TIES-NL data, as part of the overall TIES Project (see also the TIES website),  surveyed respondents aged 18-35 who are native-born children of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants (the second generation) and their peers without an immigration background (the ‘comparison group’) in two main Dutch cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The overall aim of the project is to collect valuable and comparable information on specific second-generation groups in 15 European cities, in order to measure their level of integration in many spheres (such as, but not limited to, education and the labour market) and the impact of context on integration.                       
                      
The survey comprises the following modules: education, labour market, partner, parents, housing and neighbourhood, social relations and political participation, gender roles and child care, identity, religion, income and psychosocial, personal relations. See also the file with the questionnaire for more details. Relevant data at neighbourhood and municipality level for Rotterdam and Amsterdam were collected from CBS Statline and added to the dataset. Note that the data is coded to fit the international questionnaire, in order to facilitate comparisons with the other TIES surveys.
<###34355###>The Dzarylgac Survey Project The Džarylgač Survey Project (DSP) is an archaeological research project that, using a variety of field survey methods, aims to study the interaction between Greek colonists and indigenous populations in northwestern Crimea (present-day Ukraine) during the late Classical and early Hellenistic period (late 5th - 3rd century BC). The project, named after the lake around which fieldwork was done, entails field surveys, test excavations, environmental studies and geophysical prospections and has furnished important new insights in the local settlement history, not only during the period of Greek presence but also for the Bronze Age and early modern period.

<###34416###>REFLEX - REsearch into employment and professional FLExibility A survey among higher education graduates in fifteen European countries.                
The REFLEX project focuses on three broad and interrelated questions: (1) which competencies are required by higher education graduates in order to function adequately in the knowledge society; (2) what role is played by higher education institutions in helping graduates to develop these competencies;  (3) what tensions arise as graduates, higher education institutions, employers and other key players each strive to meet their own objectives, and how can these tensions be resolved.
<###34417###>HEGESCO - Higher education as a generator of strategic competences. A survey of higher education graduates in five East European countries, Lithunia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey.                  
The project 'Higher Education as a Generator of Strategic Competences' (HEGESCO) addresses the needs of the main groups of higher education (HE) stakeholders who are interested in the employability of graduates. Based on several project reports, higher education institutions have been provided with empirically based evidence for planning their curricula, strategies and general orientations. Employers have been provided with evidence how skills, qualifications and job descriptions are developed, identified, interpreted, adapted, transferred, selected and rewarded. Policy makers at the national and European level have been provided with evidence on the implementation of the Bologna process. Higher education graduates learnt and reflected on their higher education learning experiences and the importance of other determinants of their career success. The scientific community have been provided with the Hegesco large scale survey database, which together with the Reflex database presents one of the largest graduate employability surveys in Europe and worldwide.                        
                      
In all of its activities, the project addresses two broad questions that were already initiated in the Hegesco project’s predecessor – the 'Reflex' project (short for Research into Employment and professional FLEXibility): “Which competences are required by higher education graduates in order to be better equipped for the world of work and active citizenship?” and “How should higher education institutions best contribute to the development of these competences?” These two questions present a general framework for further surveying requirements in the labour market, the match between acquired and required competences, the general characteristics of higher education institutions, such as academic or vocation orientation, and the role of different learning and teaching modes. The findings of the Hegesco project are based on a large scale survey with a gross sample size of more than 30,000 graduates, and qualitative interviews among employers and HE institutions from five partner countries. The empirical work that has been conducted in Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovenian and Turkey is compatible with the results of the Reflex project, which enables a cross-country comparison of nineteen  European countries.

<###35607###>Animals in Roman Times in the Dutch Eastern River Area This archeozoological study concerns the animal remains that were found during excavations of settlements dating from Roman times in Nijmegen and its surroundings. The aim of the study was to acquire detailed information about the animals, in particular as regards their function.

Faunal remains from the following settlements were included in the study: native farmsteads in Ewijk and Heteren, the villa in Druten, civilian settlements in Nijmegen, military forts (castella) in Nijmegen and Meinerswijk and a camp village, belonging to such a fort, in Kesteren, the mid-Roman legionary camp (castra) and the camp village surrounding it (canabae legionis) in Nijmegen. In addition an investigation was made of animal bones found in the Gallo-Roman temples in Eist and a fourth-century cemetery in Nijmegen.

The mammal species that were represented can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of farm animals that were eaten: cattle, sheep, goat and pig. The second group consists of wild animals: aurochs, elk, red deer, roe deer, wild boar and hare. Also these animals were eaten, in view of the butchery marks that are present on the bones. In addition shed antlers were collected incidentally for the purpose of making particular objects out of them. The third group is formed by horse and dog, domesticated animals that were not eaten. If we compare the first two groups it is clear that the hunting of larger game animals was of very little significance for the pattern of meat consumption. Within the group of farm animals the most important meat-providing species is cattle. Pig and sheep/goat come in second and third place in turn. Relatively high percentages of pig can be associated on the one. hand with the better facilities for grazing pigs on the Pleistocene soils, and on the other hand with the military or Roman character of settlements. Higher percentages of sheep/goat can be associated especially with an environment suitable for sheep in the Holocene area. The remains of birds and fish come for the most part from only a few sieve-samples. The data obtained for these groups will therefore be very incomplete. The most common species among the poultry is the domestic fowl. At some sites also goose, duck and pigeon were found. Concerning these last three species it is not certain whether the remains found represent domesticated or wild forms. The remains that were found of crane, cormorant and long-eared owl certainly came from wild birds. Fishing was also practised, and the species caught include pike, rudd, orfe or chub, perch, allis shad or twaite shad, eel, salmon and catfish. An exotic fish is represented by the find, dating from the fourth century, of a vertebra of the genus Sphyraena, a kind of barracuda, that only occurs in warm seas. This specimen probably arrived here as a fish product, in the liquamen or allée, or as salted fish. At a few sites remains of oysters and whelks were found, which must have been brought inland from the coast.

The data on cattle, sheep/goat and pig present a picture of an agrarian economy based on mixed farming with the emphasis on agriculture. Cattle were not kept primarily for milk production, nor primarily as a source of meat, despite the fact that beef was the kind of meat most frequently eaten. Rather they were kept in the first place as a source of traction power and of manure for agricultural purposes. In addition smaller numbers of pigs and sheep were kept for their meat, and in the case of sheep also for the supply of wool and milk (cheese). Also the production of manure for fertilizing the soil will have played a role in keeping these smaller farm animals. Agricultural products were much more important than meat for the diet of the local inhabitants. It is even questionable whether meat formed part of the daily menu. Horses were kept as pack animals, for riding or as a supply of traction power. Cattle, sheep and horses were skinned for their hides. The bones were used only incidentally for the purpose of making particular objects.

The fact that in the first and second century the size of cattle increases considerably can be explained by the development of improved exploitation techniques as a result of the availability of Roman know-how with regard to agriculture. This could have involved better nutrition and better treatment of the animals and the use of a more refined breeding regime with native cattle with the aim of obtaining more traction power. Large cattle were probably imported as well.

A description of the individual settlements and the bone material found there is given in chapter 3. The bone refuse of the early Roman castellum (Nijmegen la) appeared to have been removed intentionally away from the fortification. Most of this material was found outside the castellum in the neighbourhood of the western entrance. Also in the settlement on the Valkhof (Nijmegen Ib-c) the bone refuse is concentrated in a few places: more than half the material was found in three refuse pits. In terms of the composition the material from these refuse pits did not differ from the bone material found elsewhere. As for the two associated settlements, the mid-Roman canabae legionis and the castra, there was no evidence of any differences between them relating to the incidence of slaughtering animals and the consumption of meat. The finds of indisputably primary butchery refuse indicate that cattle were brought into the camp on the hoof and were ultimately slaughtered there. In certain places in the canabae bone concentrations were found that are indicative of specialization in meat processing. In the western canabae the smoking of shoulders of beef probably took place. In the eastern canabae skulls of cattle were processed for the production of a kind of brawn. These meat products may have been intended for the inhabitants of the army camp. In the large fourth-century defensive ditch in Nijmegen the Ijone material was found mostly concentrated at one spot. It is likely that after the ditch had lost its defensive function it was used as a rubbish dump. The concentration of the material could indicate that at that spot a road ran up to the ditch; alternatively there may have been a bridge over the ditch here. The bone finds from the fourth-century cemetery come from meals for the dead, provided on dishes or plates at the time of burial, to sustain the deceased during the journey to the next world. The meat for the dead consisted mainly of pork and chicken, while the meat diet of the living consisted mainly of beef. Comparison with other settlements and cemeteries from Roman times shows that this was a general phenomenon. If we take into consideration the information given by the epicurean cookery book of Apicius, then we must conclude that the dead were provided with a more sumptuous meal than that to which the living were accustomed to eating. A remarkable feature of the castellum of Meinerswijk is that no bones of horses were found there. Carcasses of animals that were not eaten were usually buried outside the settlement, however, as was also the case in Kesteren; for example. At the entrance of each of the two most important buildings (i and 11) of the villa in Druten (II) two horse skeletons were found. These skeletons probably represent foundation sacrifices. In contrast to Druten III, in Druten II there is a distinct difference in the bone material found in the pars urbana and the pars rustica of the settlement. The presence of foundation sacrifices, the predominance of pig over sheep/goat, and the greater species diversity in the pars urbana can be associated with the higher status of the occupants in this part of the villa. The deviating age of the cattle found at the temples in Eist can be associated with the function of cattle as sacrificial animals as proposed by Bogaers (1955). The fact that the cattle from the period before the temples were built show the same pattern of age at the time of slaughter provides support for the view that this site was already a place of cultic significance before the building of the temples. The find of a unique combination of the skulls of a pig, a sheep and an ox, bearing in mind the sex and size of the animals they came from, provides an extra argument for regarding these bones as the remains of a suovetaurilia sacrifice.

The function of animals kept in the Eastern River Area in Roman times was to a great extent conscerned with agriculture. They provided traction power and manure. In addition they were a source of meat, for both the living and the dead, and were used as sacrificial offerings. Hides and wool were made use of, and occasionally bone was used as a raw material for making particular objects.

<###36065###>Tracing traces from present to past : a functional analysis of pre-Columbian shell and stone artefacts from Anse à la Gourde and Morel, Guadeloupe, FWI  This thesis presents the study of the possibilities of functional analysis on shell implements. Shell tools  from the pre-Columbian sites of Anse à la Gourde and Morel, Guadeloupe were studied and interpreted based on archaeological, ethnographical, ethnohistorical and experimental data. In addition, flint and stone tools of both sites were analysed. In this thesis functional analysis is approached from an integral point of view in order to be able to reconstruct the past technological system. The results of the functional analysis of all artefact categories are presented as well as a reconstruction of the technological system in the pre-Columbian period. It is demonstrated how this integral approach provides the possibilities to shed light on the choices made in the past on tool use and the utilisation of different raw materials.

<###36116###>Underwater archaeological investigations of a shipwreck near the Eemshaven, municipality Eemsmond (Gr.) Between Norway and The Netherlands, a high-voltage power cable (NorNed) is planned and realised by Norwegian Statnett SF and Dutch TenneT TSO BV. Periplus Archeomare BV carried out a side-scan sonar survey of the bottom of the eastern Wadden sea. As a result of this survey, a small number of locations was selected for further investigation. The main aim was to determine the archaelogical potential of these locations. At a distance of 29 meters from the proposed route of the electricity cable, a shipwreck was discovered on location D1.
On the 19th, 20th and 21st of April, 2006, Archaeological Research & Consultancy (ARC bv), Groningen, participated in investigating the potentially interesting locations, D1, D2 and D5, by a diving-unit, carried out by Subcom BV and managed by Periplus Archeomare BV. On behalf of ARC bv drs. C.G. Koopstra and mw. drs. J.B. Hielkema, both senior archaeologists, participated in the fieldwork.
The finds from location D1, consisting of wooden samples from the wreck and a human bone, were studied by drs. ing. G.J. de Roller and mw. drs. G.M.A. Bergsma. Prof. dr. H.R. Reinders, Groninger Institute of Archaeology (RUG) and drs.W. Kerkmeijer, head collection and conservator of the Noordelijk Scheepvaartmuseum, Groningen, were so kind as to provide additional information about shipwrecks in general, including their archaeological potention.

Near the Eemshaven a shipwreck was discovered, that dates from the latter part of the 17th century. Dendrochronological dating of wood from this ship indicates that the ship was built after 1667 AD. The relatively huge size of the planks and beams indicate that it may be a large seafaring ship. The remains that are still embedded in the clay, are well preserved. The parts of the ship that are exposed, however, are afflicted by shipworm, white paddock and probably other sea-organisms. This means that erosion of the ship will continue, unless some action is undertaken to consolidate the condition of the shipwreck.

<###36701###>World values survey 1990 1995 2000 2005 Values and cultural changes in societies all over the world.         
Basic values and beliefs  in a wide variety of areas. Broad topics covered are leisure, work, meaning and purpose of life, family life, and contemporary social issues. In the section on leisure respondents were asked whether they preferred to spend their leisure time relaxing or being active, about groups and associations to which they belonged, how often they read a daily newspaper, the number of hours watching television, whether they experienced feelings such as loneliness, boredom, restlessness, depression and happiness, if they felt other people could be trusted, if they felt they had free choice and control over their lives, and if they were satisfied with life overall. Topics covered relating to work include aspects important in a job, pride in work, satisfaction with present job and financial situation, and owner/state/employee management of business. A wide range of items was included on the meaning and purpose of life, such as respondent's view on the value of scientific advances, things in life that were worth sacrificing everything for, opinions on good and evil, and religious behaviour and beliefs. Respondents were queried regarding closeness among family members, their level of satisfaction with their home life, if they shared the same attitudes toward such things as religion, morality, politics, and sexual mores with their partner and parents, their views on marriage and divorce, and qualities important for a child to learn. In the final section on social issues, areas covered include the respondent's interest in politics, opinion of various forms of political action, self-placement on a political left, right scale and party identification, the most important aims for their country, alcohol and alcoholism, confidence in various civil and governmental institutions, and whether they felt divorce, abortion, suicide, cheating on taxes, lying, and other such actions were ever justified.

<###36799###>Kunera - Database for late medieval badges and ampullae Badges and ampullae are the material witnesses to the rich and fascinating visual world of the late Middle Ages.
Often only unique copies or – in rare instances – some duplicates of the same mould were passed down, even though the objects were mass-produced at the time. The material played a major part in the dissemination of imagery from the late twelfth century to the middle of the sixteenth century. From the middle of the fifteenth century, printing gradually took over. Depictions on badges and ampullae differ from Christ, Mary and the saints to utensils, plants and animals, literary and sexual subjects. In addition, the pilgrims’ souvenirs that were produced in one place and lost in another, give a perception of travel routes. Where did pilgrims go and how many miles did their travels cover? The website Kunera offers access to over 15.000 badges and ampullae of religious and profane subjects. The pilgrimage sites and the sites where the objects were found are mapped out visualizing the dissemination of the objects and the travel routes at a single glance. 

The goal of Kunera as a research project of the Radboud University is twofold. On the one hand, we try to increase knowledge about late medieval (pilgrimage) culture. Therefore, the registered data are accessible to a large audience of (amateur) archeologists, scientists and other interested parties. On the other hand, the database serves a documentary goal. Badges and ampullae are often produced of pewter. The material is liable to oxidation, when it is exposed to oxygen. Damage of the fragile objects is almost inevitable. Not just a registration of the material information is necessary; also the finds’ circumstances need documentation. When the objects are in private hands, data of the archeological site and provenance are often lost after time. The research team of Kunera strives to research as much badges and ampullae as possible in order to safeguard valuable details of this historically important material.

The database can be found on the Kunera website.
<###37201###>Blood is thicker than water: Amerindian intra- and inter-insular relationships and social organization in the pre-Colonial Windward Islands This study represents a contribution to the pre-Colonial archaeology of the Windward Islands in the Caribbean. The research aimed to determine how the Ceramic Age (ca. 400 BC – AD 1492) Amerindian inhabitants of the region related to one another and others at various geographic scales, with a view to better understanding social interaction and organization within the Windward Islands as well the integration of this region within the macro region.

This research approached the study of intra- and inter-island interaction and social development through an island-by-island study of some 640 archaeological sites and their ceramic assemblages. Besides providing insight into settlement sequences, patterns and micro mobility through time, it also highlighted various configurations of sites spread across different islands that were united by shared ceramic (decorative) traits. These configurations were more closely examined by taking recourse to graph theory.

By extending the comparative scope of this research to the Greater Antilles and the South American mainland, possible material cultural influences from more distant regions could be suggested. While Windward Island communities certainly developed a localized material cultural identity, they remained open to a host of wide-ranging influences outside the Windward Island micro region. As such, rather than representing a cultural backwater operating in the periphery of a burgeoning Taíno empire, it is argued that Windward Island communities actively and flexibly realigned themselves with several mainland South American societies in Late Ceramic Age times (ca. AD 700-1500), forging and maintaining significant ties and exchange relationships.

<###38457###>Built Environments, Constructed Societies Archaeology, as the discipline that searches to explain the development of society by means of material remains, has been avoiding the big issues involved with its research agenda. The topic of social evolution is concealed by anxiety about previous paradigmatic malpractice and the primary archaeological division of the world in culture areas still suffers from the archaic methods by which it was established. Archaeological inference of developing societies is weighed down by its choice of particularism within agency approaches and overtly reductionist due to the prevalence of statistical, classificatory and biological approaches.
This book addresses these issues through a perspective on the spatial analysis of the built environment. As one of the principal properties of our dataset, as well as being the first materialisation of sociality, such spatialities are suggested to be a fundamental key for enabling an understanding of the developing social identity of places, regions and areas. In order to arrive at a truly social inference of spatial datasets, archaeology’s usual analysis working from material remains towards socio-cultural interpretations needs to be inverted. The vantage point of this study consists of aprioristic social theory. It constructs its arguments through an epistemological foundation comprising a selection of essential ideas regarding the three constitutive axes of developing societies: time, human action and human space. As it recognises the inherent position of these axes combined in the discipline of human geography, a historical comparison of these two disciplines presents the angle from which plausible theoretical advancements can be made. The core of the book explores selected works of human geographers Allan Pred, Benno Werlen and Andreas Koch against the backdrop of theories like structuration or systems theory, phenomenology, action theory, and to a lesser extent Actor Network Theory and autopoiesis. From this follows its own theoretical proposal called the social positioning of spatialities. On this basis hypotheses for methodological opportunities are discussed, establishing a research agenda.
Firmly placing its efforts in current paradigmatic debates in the discipline, this study offers archaeological theorists an incentive to leave the safety of materially bound science and adapt an alternative perspective. It is an attempt to put archaeology back in the forefront of the social theoretical debates it should contribute to.
<###38486###>Threatening Identities: Interaction and Conflict in the Multicultural Netherlands (LISS Core Study) In January 2009, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire about multi-cultural society in the Netherlands. Non-native panel members were presented questions about their own population group, while native Dutch respondents were assigned to groups at random. Depending on the group to which they were assigned, they were presented questions about one of the non-native population groups (Antilleans, Indonesians, Moroccans, Surinamese or Turks).
<###38484###>Feedback Mechanisms in Matrix Questions (LISS Core Study) The study focuses on feedback mechanisms in matrix questions.         
         
In August 2008, a questionnaire on feedback in matrix questions was administered to the LISS panel. This questionnaire dealt with attention and usability in online surveys from a respondents’ perspective. The experiment used grey out and highlighting. After having answered an item, either the active table cell or the whole row was shaded to indicate that no further action is needed for this item and that a response has been recorded. Highlight was used as a mouse-over effect, the table cell or the whole row under the mouse pointer was shaded to indicate the focus of attention. This shading was moving along with the mouse pointer.
<###38485###>Using Interactive Features to Motivate and Probe Responses to Open-Ended Questions (LISS Core Study) The project explores how interactive features in web surveys can influence respondent behavior.         
In August 2008, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire on the effect of including motivational statements and follow-up probes on response length and response quality of the responses to open-ended questions. The questionnaire included four open-ended questions and several closed-ended questions about the current situation in Dutch society. Respondents to the internet survey were randomly assigned to one of the four versions of the open-ended questions. The control version simply displayed the open-ended question; no motivating statement was included with the question and respondents were not branched to a follow-up probe. In the second version the open-ended question included the motivational statement ‘This question is very important to our survey’, but similar to the control version, respondents were not asked a follow-up probe. In the third version respondents were asked the open-ended question and after they submitted their initial response, they were branched to a follow-up probe screen. This screen displayed the respondent’s answer to the initial open-ended question and a follow-up probe (e.g., ‘Is there anything else you would like to add?’). Respondents to the fourth version were also asked the initial open-ended question and then branched to a follow-up probe with a motivational statement. In addition, people who did not answer the initial open-ended question (or who provided an answer like ‘don’t know’ or other answers that were less than four characters) were routed to a nonrespondent version that displayed the text ‘Please provide a response. This question is very important to our survey” and repeated the open-ended question.

<###38758###>Population and housing census of the Netherlands, 28 February 1971 This study contains the Dutch population and housing census of Februari 28th 1971. The data are divided in nine different files, each relating to a different unit of observation. These units are: the municipality, the district, the neigbourhood, the address, the house, the household following the definitions of 1960 and 1947 (two different units of observation), the nuptiality (huwelijks vruchtbaarheid), and the individual. The first four units of observation contain fixed data on the municipalities and their subdivisions in districts, neighbourhoods and adresses. The other five units of observation contain the actual data collected in the door to door census, these data are collected and archived nationally. To research subdivisions in the Dutch population, one has to link together the files.  The quality of the data is very good. A small portion of the Dutch population was counted administrative (2.3 %), for the most part, these people weren't at home during the census. Few of them actually banned the census, however this was only 0.15 % of the total population. These citizens were absorbed through the register of population and other administrative records.

<###39042###>Brabantse zesdeklassers, 1952-2010 In 1952, data about the scholastic achievements were collected for a large sample of sixth form pupils of primary schools in the Province of Noord Brabant. In 1983 and 1993, the same sample was used anew for postal surveys about further educational careers, labour market experience, and variables related to entrepreneurship. In 2000 and 2010, mortality data from public records for the period after 1994 were added.        
To analyse the dataset on longevity aspects it is necessary to use the related dataset 'Brabantse zesdeklassers, peroonsgegevens, 1994-2010.       
       
Of course there has been a considerable wastage in the process: while the initial 1952 sample consisted of about 5800 individuals they could not all be located in 1983 or 1993, and moreover there was sizable nonresponse in the postal surveys. As a result, the databases of 1994 and later years refer to a reduced sample of about 3000 individuals who all participated in the 1952 survey and at least one of the 1983 and 1993 surveys.

<###39194###>Een fysisch anthropologisch onderzoek van begravenen bij het Minderbroedersklooster te Dordrecht, circa 1275-1572 AD Remains of 316 burials that were excavated from the Late Medieval cemetery of the Franciscan Friary at Dordrecht (Province of South Holland) have been analysed.The buried persons were mainly citizens who had been interred here between c. 1275 and 1572 AD. At that time, Dordrecht was the prosperous main commercial centre of the County of Holland in the western part of the Low Countries. From the demographical and paleopathological results the assumption seems to be reasonable that this group of citizens had a life expectancy which was not unusual for that period.
The age at death distribution shows a slight lack of males in the 30-40 years interval, which might be the result of the manyfold compulsory drafts for the armed forces of the Count of Holland and/or of commerce related burials of men abroad. From the frequencies of paleopathological changes it can be concluded that the general health status was reasonable and typical for an urban population.There were no unusual exposures to traumas, infections, dietary deficiencies, etc. From the calculated stature of the men, being a parameter of socio-economic status, and from the relative high frequency of DISH one may conclude that the population was even 'well-off' compared to Dutch citizens of the 17th and 18th centuries.

<###39472###>Are Effective Emotion Regulation Strategies Associated with Financial Capability? (LISS Core Study) In August 2010, the LISS panel completed a questionnaire on emotions and finance. The major aim of this study is to examine whether higher levels of effective emotion regulation strategies are associated with higher levels of financial capability overall, and for the five separate domains (making ends meet, keeping track of one’s finance, staying informed on financial products, how individuals go about selecting a financial product, and planning ahead).
<###39478###>Public Attitudes Towards and Knowledge of Conditional Sentences (LISS Core Study) In October 2010, the LISS panel was presented with two questionnaires about conditional sentences. In one survey (the correlation survey, part 2), the correlation between penal attitudes and knowledge of conditional sentences was measured on the one hand and attitudes towards conditional sentences on the other.            
           
In the second survey (the experimental survey, part 1), participants were given information (short descriptions) about conditional sentences to measure the influence of this information (and hence knowledge) on attitudes while also taking into consideration the general penal attitude of participants. Four distinct groups were differentiated: group 1 received additional information on the effectiveness of conditional sentences; group 2 received additional information on the nature of the conditional sentences; group 3 received additional information on both the nature and effectiveness of the conditional sentences while, finally, group 4 received no additional information (control condition).
<###39487###>Database on cargo flows in the port of Rotterdam, 1880-2000 This dataset was created for the research project: Rotterdam-Antwerp, a century and a half of port competition, 1880-2000. The aim of the project was to investigate different variables that influence competition between these ports and their overall effect on cargo flows. This dataset only contains statistics on Rotterdam. (Dataset D0095 contains the data collected on the port of Antwerp.) The statistics offer detailed time-series on international cargo flows passing through Rotterdam. Cargo shipped to and from the port by domestic short-sea shipping is not registered by the sources, because in this kind of transport no border is crossed. Furthermore, like sea-borne transport, only hinterland transport from and to Rotterdam that has a foreign origin or destination is registered in the available statistical series. In other words, not all maritime-related hinterland transport is registered: transports within the Netherlands are missing. On the other hand, the hinterland data also contain cargo flows that have no relation with sea-borne transport to and from Rotterdam at all. It is not possible to assess the volume of these so-called continental transports. They consist for instance of exports by Rotterdam manufacturing firms to neighbouring European countries. This is a very important feature of the database. It implies that it is not possible to match the sea-borne traffic with the hinterland transports or, in other words, to assess the total modal split in hinterland transport of cargo that is shipped to and from Rotterdam by sea. The database is organized around the following general categories of cargo flows: 1. imports 2. inward bound transit 3. all incoming cargo 4. exports 5. outward bound transit 6. all outgoing cargo. All files can be downloaded from the website: http://www.fhk.eur.nl/websites/ra/index.htm  
<###39545###>Maritime Archaeological Field Assessment NorNed Cable HVDC Project, Eemshaven, The Netherlands In April 2006 several dive inspections were executed along the intended route of the Norned HV DC Electrical Cable between The Netherlands and Norway. These visual underwater inspections are the second phase of the archaeological assessment of the route, or MIVO2 (Maritiem Inventariserend Veld Onderzoek or Maritime Archaeological Field Assessment). The purpose of these inspections was to establish the possible archaeological value of observed phenomena on the seabed, which were determined from several hydrographic and geophysical data sets.

A total of 5 locations were eventually chosen in collaboration with RACM (former ROB: Rijksdienst voor Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek or the Dutch Archaeological Survey) based on the assessment of hydrographic and geophysical datasets.

The visual underwater inspections were carried out by Subcom BV from Zierikzee under supervision of Periplus Archeomare BV. 

On one of the locations the remnants of a large historic shipwreck was discovered, dated at around 1667. After the discovery of this shipwreck, ARC from Groningen carried out the archaeological assessment of the recovered parts of the wreck.

Although located at about 15 meters from the intended cable route, the extent of the wreck location did not interfere with the general cable laying operations. Therefore no deviation form this route was deemed necessary and laying operations could be carried out as planned.

Phenomena on other locations did not reveal any further archaeological values.

<###39576###>Anglo-African trade, 1699-1808 This dataset contains figures on the trade between England and Africa during the period 1699-1808: imports, exports, re-exports and indirect imports. A distinction is made between different trade flows (Londen, outports, re-exports in time and out of time, etc.). Quantities and values are given for 1100 different commodities in the eighteenth century, units (also decimalized) and pounds. Aggregates are given for each year and for each type of trade. The dataset also includes the total trade figures for England between 1700 until 1800. The dataset has been created for research purposes, in order to analyse the trade between England and Africa in the eighteenth century. The dataset has been deposited at the NHDA after the death of the original data-collector, M. Johnson, without any documentation.

The public `reading' behaviour is the main theme of the dataset. It is separated in data on the readers and on the transactions of literature from the client books of the bookshop Van Benthem in Middelburg. The whole dataset is divided in two periods: 1807-1809 and 1847-1849. For both periods data are collected about the clients, the transactions and the titles that are bought. Besides these main files, also data on occupations, addresses, relationships of clients and data from several membership lists are collected. The files in this dataset are available by a special program which is made for the research project of the Research Institute of History and Culture (OGC: `Onderzoeksinstituut voor Geschiedenis en Cultuur') in Utrecht. Two files are not documented here because they are used for arithmetical purposes.

<###40816###>CLIWOC - Climatological Database for the World's Oceans 1750-1850 (release 1.5) The principal objective of the CLIWOC project was to realise the scientific potential of logbook climatic data and to produce a database of daily weather observations for the world's oceans between 1750 and 1850. Another objective was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of climatic change over the oceans for the century after 1750 when logbooks became abundant and to link with existing databases such as the I-COADS dataset (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set). The study period is also significant because it marks a period when climatic change cannot be seen as a consequence of world-wide industrialization and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The files of the Dutch part of the CLIWOC dataset are divided into three major clusters: 721 Access database files, 418 digitized ships' logbooks (jpg-files) and 369 webpages. These clusters are described under 'Data collections'. One of the project's main achievements was the preparation of a database drawing on British, Dutch, French and Spanish naval logbook records for the immediate pre-instrumental period (1750-1853). This database is freely available on the KNMI website (http://www.knmi.nl/cliwoc/cliwocdata.htm).

<###40815###>Molecular studies of organic residues preserved in ancient vessels This study is aimed at the molecular characterisation of solid organic (food) residues preserved in an assemblage of vessels recovered from an indigenous settlement dating back to the Iron Age and Roman period at Uitgeest – Groot Dorregeest (The Netherlands). Analytical thermal-fragmentation techniques such as Curie-point pyrolysis Mass Spectrometry and Direct Temperature-resolved Mass Spectrometry gave information about a wide range of compound classes as diverse as lipids, waxes, polynuclear aromatic compounds, oligosaccharides, small peptides and protein fragments, and a variety of thermally stable (more or less condensed) polymeric char structures. Multivariate analysis identified different chemotypes: groups of residues with comparable chemical characteristics. The biomolecular origin of these chemotypes was identified by comparison with experimentally charred reference materials and the application of complementary analytical techniques such as FTIR and 13C CP/MAS NMR. The chemotypes A1 and A2 consist of charred residues identified as starch-rich foods (mixed with either animal or plant products), chemotype C consists of protein-rich charred animal products without starch, chemotype B contains smoke condensates from wood fires, and chemotype D consists of special protein-rich and lipid-free foods or non-food products. Although many molecular characteristics of the original foods have been lost as a result of extensive thermal degradation and interpretation remains limited to general food groups, the results give valuable direct evidence of ancient diet and vessel-use.

Deze interviews vormen een onderdeel van een project uitgevoerd door het United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Oral History Department, waar het valt onder de 'Europe Interview Projects: Interviews with Witnesses, Collaborators, and Perpetrators'. Naast de Nederlandse interviews zijn er ook interviews gemaakt in het (Wit)Russisch, Grieks, Macedonisch, Pools, Oekraiens, Servisch, Ests, Lets, Litouws, Moldavisch, Frans, Duits, Roemeens. De aantallen interviews per land variëren sterk. Het project is in 1996 begonnen en loopt nog steeds, zie website USHMM: http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/oralhistory/         
          
Since 1996, United States Holocaust memorial Museum's (USHMM) Department of Oral History has conducted a documentation project to collect the testimonies of individuals who were not direct victims of the Holocaust. These interviews are with witnesses, collaborators, and perpetrators. In ten years, over 600 interviews have been conducted in the following European countries: Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the Ukraine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia. These interviews serve not only as corroboration of what Jewish victims and survivors report in their interviews and memoirs, they also create a broader understanding of the tragic events of World War II by adding the perspectives of non-Jewish populations. The Dutch interviews are accessible at DANS for scientific research only.
<###41880###>Validation-report on the arthropod remains from a possible tanning-pit found at the Roman site of Liberchies The arthropod study presented in this report is a typical assesment of a sample to ascertain the value of a soil sample for analysis of the arthropod remains. The sample was taken from a pit which was tentatively associated with the Roman tanning industry. Some parts of the sample had already been studied by paleo-botanists and the presence of beetle remains had been demonstrated. The remaining part of the sample, weighing 2: kilograms, was available for the study of arthropod remains.
<###41884###>Roman Aardenburg: castellum or fortified town? Veldtekeningen van de opgravingen te Aardenburg. Door J.A. Trimpe Burger en zijn opvolgers zijn tussen 1955 en 1996 veel opgravingen uitgevoerd waarbij voornamelijk resten van een Romeinse nederzetting en de Middeleeuwse stad zijn aangetroffen.

Summary Odyssee project
The Roman settlement of Aardenburg (in the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands) was excavated with great precision from 1955 until 1988. The features and finds from these large-scale excavations demonstrate an enormous potential for enhancing our knowledge of the Roman coastal occupation and defence works during the late 2nd and 3rd century AD. Unfortunately, no study has thus far been carried out to fully integrate the excavation data and interpret these data in a regional, international and historical context. From recent excavations in Flanders, northern France and the United Kingdom, it is clear that the Romans built important defence systems along the North Sea coast in the 2nd and 3rd century AD. The knowledge of these defences on Dutch territory is poor. The quality of the data from Aardenburg is pristine and enormous steps can be made in the understanding and knowledge concerning this "coastal limes", not only within the Dutch context, but also on an international scale. The aim of this research project is to gain insight in the nature, chronology of this supposed military site, through critical evaluation and study of the excavation data and by studying specific material culture categories in their contexts.

This research will result in publications for both the (international) scientific and the public community. Furthermore, the project aims to provide the basis for further academic research in which the socio-economic relations of the Roman settlement at Aardenburg within the region and within interregional trade-networks can be studied.
<###41881###>Report on the analysis of arthropod remains from a possible tanning-pit found at the Roman site of Liberchies, Belgium This report presents the results of the study of remains of invertebrate animals found in sample 12010 taken from a pit tentatively associated with the Roman tanning industry. Validation of the sample had already demonstrated that the sample yielded sufficient arthropod remains for a more thorough analysis. For a description of the sample and the extraction method used I would like to refer to the relevant sections in the validation report (Scarab-report 049).
<###42015###>Scrapheap Challenge Hallum: Archaeometallurgical investigation of a 3rd century bronze hoard In 2007 in the Frisian town of Hallum, a large copper depot was found in a ditch close to the town’s original dwelling mound. The 3rd century AD bronze hoard consists of over fourteen hundred thin-walled tableware fragments, including fragments of bronze cauldrons and pieces of Roman wine sieves. The depot is interpreted as tinker or coppersmith’s scrap metal. Using handheld XRF spectrometry the composition of the fragments was analysed to reconstruct the objects to determine the typology of the cauldrons.
In addition, the origin of the objects was determined by comparing the composition of the depot with the composition of eight Roman and local Iron Age reference data sets, six of which were collected during the course of this project. To gain insight in the composition and to identify clusters of objects with a similar composition, the compositional data of the Hallum hoard and the reference sets were plotted in histograms, scatter plots and ternary diagrams, and cluster analysis was performed. Furthermore, it was attempted to determine the level of recycling of the material based on the composition of the fragments.
The results show that the Hallum hoard consists of fragments from many (probably over hundred), incomplete objects. From most objects only a handful of fragments is present, making reconstruction impossible. However, the typology of the cauldrons could be determined based on the composition of the fragments. Most fragments probably originate from 3rd century Westland cauldrons and contemporary Sau type Östland buckets.
The origin of most fragments is probably Roman, as the distribution of the composition of the Hallum fragments matches the distribution of compositional data in the reference sets containing Roman objects. The hypothesis of a Roman origin for - at least part of - the Hallum material is further strengthened by the presence of Roman wine sieves fragments. However, it is unclear whether the objects crossed the border as complete, functional objects or as scrap metal. The composition and origin of the depot provide new insights into metalworking and trading in- and outside the Roman Empire.
The level of recycling was difficult to determine. The presence of a mix-series from brass to bronze suggests most brass fragments have been recycled. The level of recycling of the bronze objects is unclear, but this is expected to be low considering the standardistion of compositions.
<###42162###>A collection of 1069 images of archaeological drawings and 949 pictures of finds from Valkenburg (ZH) (Roman period) After Valkenburg was bombed during the 2nd World War, many excavations were undertaken, resulting in large amounts of unique finds, mainly from the Roman period. From 1997 - 2004 a selection of this material was used by the IPP (UvA) for educational purposes. Pictures were taken of many of the finds, and also a data base was created containing the archaeological drawings.
<###42377###>Perceived Diversity Effects on Organizational Outcomes (LISS Core Study) In September 2010, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire about diversity in organizations with the aim of gaining insight into how employees perceive diversity in an average organization, and how this affects organizational outcomes.
<###42371###>Sexuality and media use (LISS Core Study) In September 2009 (wave 1) and March 2010 (wave 2), the LISS panel completed a questionnaire about sexuality and media use. This study incorporated a number of experiments into the effects of question response and question context on the answers provided by participants.
<###42373###>Ambiguity Aversion and Household Portfolio Choice (LISS Core Study) In January 2010, the LISS panel completed a questionnaire about the choices one makes when confronted with a known and unknown probability distribution. The respondents were presented with three games. Each game consisted of six rounds at most. The chance of winning with the known probability distribution varied from the second round on, depending on the respondent's choice in the previous round (‘known’ or ‘unknown’). After three games, two control questions were asked. The chance of winning with these questions depended on the chance of winning in the last round of game 1. Finally, two questions were posed about risk aversion. These questions also involved a game consisting of six rounds at most. Respondents either chose the option that guaranteed winning a certain sum, or the option that offered a 50% chance of a higher amount and a 50% chance of 0 euro. The amount for the guarantee option varied from the second round on, depending on the choice made in the previous round. Respondents were assigned one of two conditions beforehand. Respondents had 50% chance of being assigned condition 1, and 50% chance of condition 2. Within a household, panel members were assigned the same condition. Respondents under condition 1 knew that this involved a fictitious game and that no extra reward would be paid out. Respondents under condition 2 were informed that a real game would be played at the end, in which they could earn an extra reward of 15 euros.

The original format of the dataset is a Microsoft Access '97 filedatabase containing 35 variables/fields, including among others: profession, the number of servants employed, assets (estate, vehicles, income), tax category ("klasse") and tax assessment.   The original Microsoft Access database file has been converted to a comma separated value file format (.csv / delimiter: semi-colon).     
<###42753###>Computer use 2002-2008 During a longitudinal study at the Erasmus MC - University Medical Center, more than 1000 employees were followed using registration software on their computers. The computer users performed a variety of jobs (secretaries, researchers, managers, medical personnel, professors, etc), using a variety of software. Participants performed their daily work while the software logged mouse cursor changes (10 Hz), keystrokes, mouse clicks and mouse scroll events, whenever these events occurred. The database consists of 1296 folders (95919 files) containing data from individual computer users.                                   
The dataset can be used to perfom your own analysis or you can collaborate with the Erasmus MC Kineos Research Group to perform certain types of analysis. Possible analyses are detailed risk assessment regarding computer use and health complaints or analysis of pause, mouse and keyboard use in subgroups of computer users with specific characteristcs (such as job function, age, gender etc, etc).                                  
                                
Due to the size of this main dataset (almost 100.000 files), the files cannot be accessed online but will be made available in another way after additional contact with DANS and/or the depositor of the data.                    
                               
In a separate additional database data are available on the characteristics of the computer users (such as job type, occurrence of RSI complaints, handedness, software usage). These data were collected using questionnaires sent to the participants of the study. This database will contain the same personal ID so both databases can be linked.

<###43770###>Preserving the Early Past: Investigation, selection and preservation of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes In the spring of 2001, the National Service for Archaeological Heritage in the Netherlands and the Netherlands School of Archaeological Research (ARCHON) organised a three-day international symposium on early prehistoric archaeology and archaeological heritage management (AHM), entitled ‘Preserving the Early Past. Investigation, selection and preservation of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes’.
The symposium was held from 20 to 22 November 2002 at the headquarters of the National Service for Archaeological Heritage in the Medieval town of Amersfoort. During the first two days, 18 invited speakers – all archaeologists working in different countries in northwestern Europe and actively involved in Palaeolithic and/or Mesolithic archaeology and AHM – presented a variety of topics related to the central theme of the symposium: the investigation and management of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic cultural heritage. In addition to the invited speakers, approximately 60 professional archaeologists and students attended the symposium. A field excursion was held on 22 November. Participants travelled to the province of Flevoland for a demonstration of mechanical borings and visited nature conservancy group Stichting Gooisch Natuurreservaat in Hilversum to discuss a large collection of quartzite artefacts from the surface of an ice-pushed ridge in the vicinity of Hilversum.
There were a number of reasons for organising this international symposium. In the Netherlands, Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites have long been a rather neglected part of the archaeological record in AHM.The number of legally protected prehistoric hunter-gatherer sites is low compared to archaeological sites dating from late prehistory or the Roman period, for example. The number of sites protected by law is also manifestly in inverse proportion to the large number of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites presently known in the Netherlands. The fact that Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites are not visible in the Dutch landscape (in contrast to later prehistoric phenomena like terpen, hunebedden and burial mounds) and thus have no aesthetic value, may well be one of the reasons for this discrepancy. Furthermore, until recently virtually all the known Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites were in the higher, well-drained Pleistocene sandy and loess soils of the Netherlands. Almost all of them are surface sites in a poor state of preservation, and have consequently not been considered serious candidates for in situ preservation. Last but not least, in recent decades only a few Dutch archaeologists have focused their attention on issues associated with the in situ preservation of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains.
Since the reasons mentioned above, or at least some of them, are also likely to apply to other countries in northwestern Europe, an international symposium on the subject seemed like a useful idea. In many European countries the early prehistoric record now deserves full attention, taking into account the new demands set by the ‘European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Revised)’ which was signed at Valletta on the island of Malta in 1992. The incorporation of the Malta Convention into Dutch legislation (which is expected in 2006), for instance, requires a strong and comprehensive national policy, a major part of which should deal with Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes.Without such a policy, the loss of archaeological evidence – ranging from very small sites represented by a few stone artefacts to entire buried palaeolandscapes containing archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data – will continue and perhaps even increase as a result of planning processes.
The primary objective of the symposium was to learn about the role of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes in AHM from archaeologists working in various countries in northwestern Europe and to exchange ideas about how to investigate, assess, select and preserve this fragile archaeological resource in various environmental settings.What strategies are appropriate for the detection of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes, and how do we assess their information value? What scientific criteria should we use as a basis for deciding whether to go ahead with preservation in situ or excavation, or take no action at all? And what potential and constraints do we face in terms of the conservation and sustainable development of these Palaeolithic and Mesolithic remains? The symposium offered an opportunity to discuss these important questions with an international forum of archaeologists, making use of examples from daily practice in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, England and Germany.
This volume includes the papers presented and the main conclusions of the discussions as summarized by the chairmen (Barton, Roebroeks and Zvelebil) of three sessions of the symposium. In retrospect, we can conclude that the symposium provided a sound basis for the further development and improvement of management strategies for early prehistoric remains. As an integral part of the archaeological record, and threatened by all kind of interventions in the soil, it is evident that these remains should be treated according to the principles of the Malta Convention and with the same attention given to archaeological remains from later periods. In other words, Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes deserve full consideration in planning processes, with the aim of preservation in situ or – if preservation is not possible – conservation ex situ through excavation.
Symposia such as the one held in Amersfoort in 2002 allow us to continue the international debate on issues associated with the management of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic cultural heritage. However, appropriate management strategies are not the only prerequisite. Problem-oriented research and public awareness will be essential in the battle to protect valuable Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites and landscapes from further destruction in the near future. And one final point worthy of our attention: not all Palaeolithic and Mesolithic landscapes are equally suited to long-term preservation, even if they have the same intrinsic or physical quality. The potential offered by specific regulations, the attitude and intentions of landowners and land users, and considerations of a practical and financial nature also play an important role in determining whether preservation in situ is possible. It is equally important that we have a thorough understanding of the present qualities of an archaeological site or landscape and whether these qualities can be maintained in the long term. It does not make much sense to preserve an archaeological site on scientific grounds if one is unable to prevent it from further disturbance due to slope erosion or ploughing, for instance. If the quality of a site is likely to significantly decline over the years, excavation in advance of further destruction should be given preference over preservation.

<###44169###>Culture and Society (LISS Core Study) In August, the LISS panel was presented the questionnaire on Culture and Society.        
        
The questionnaire was presented to four different groups, namely 1) non-western immigrants of non-Turkish background, 2) first and second generation Turkish immigrants, 3) a control group consisting of native Dutch, and 4) a control group consisting of native Dutch and western immigrants.        
        
The way in which questions were presented in the questionnaire was subject to experimentation. Within a cluster of questions, part of the respondents was offered the opportunity to explain the answer they gave to a multiple-choice question.        
        
A second experiment involved the presentation of the questionnaire in a different layout. The questionnaire was unchanged in terms of content.
<###44281###>Population census December 31, 1930 The dataset is based on two separate censuses of the Netherlands of 1920, population census (7 vols) and occupational census (3 vols).

<###44578###>International Crime Victims Surveys - ICVS - 1989, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2005 Integrated Database from the International Crime Victims Survey - ICVS 1989-2005, and the European Survey on Crime and Safety - EU ICS 2005. The ICVS is a programme of standardised sample surveys  to look at householders’ experience with crime, policing, crime prevention and feelings of unsafety in a large number of countries.                   
The ICVS became operational in 1989. The main object was to seek advancement in international comparative criminological research, beyond the constraints of officially recorded crime data. The next sweeps of the ICVS surveys took place in 1992, 1996 and 2000. With its fifth sweep in 2005 the initiative has developed into a truly unique global project. Over a time span of fifteen years more than 300,000  people were interviewed about their experiences with victimisation and related subjects in 78 different countries.  The ICVS is the most comprehensive instrument developed yet to monitor  and study volume crimes, perception of crime and attitudes towards the criminal justice system in a comparative, international perspective. The data are from surveys amongst the general public and therefore not influenced by political or ideological agendas of governments of individual countries. Standardisation of questionnaires used and other aspects of data collection assure that data can, within confidence margins, be reliably compared across countries.  

The ICVS-2 (2010) is the responsibility of the Dutch WODC (Ministry of Justice) and the British Home Office.  The 2010 data (a pilot held in 6 countries) will probably become available  in 2012.

<###45027###>Nationaal Kiezersonderzoek, NKO 2006 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study 2006 (DPES/NKO 2006).           
The Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies (DPES) are a series of national surveys carried out under the auspices of the Dutch Electoral Research Foundation (SKON). These surveys have been conducted since 1970. Studies since 1971 were conducted before and after the national parliamentary elections. Panel studies are also conducted within the framework of the DPES. Many questions are replicated across studies, although each has questions not asked in the others. The major substantive areas consistently covered include the respondents' attitudes toward and expectations of the government and its effectiveness in both domestic and foreign policy, the most important problems facing the people of the Netherlands, the respondents' voting behavior and participation history, and his/her knowledge of and faith in the nation's political leaders. The data for the DPES 2006 were collected by Statistics Netherlands and by Kees Aarts, Henk van der Kolk, Martin Rosema and Martha Brinkman on behalf of the SKON. The study has been made possible by grants from Statistics Netherlands, the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK), the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK), the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS), the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), and the Department of Political Science and Research Methodology, University of Twente. In order to provide the funding agencies with essential information about the use of the data that have been collected with their assistance, each user of the data is expected to send two copies of each completed and published manuscript to the distributor of the data.           
Number of cases: 2806, number of variables: 696 .                   
A version including all variables of this survey, including variables that were dropped for reasons of privacy protections (municipality, day of birth, exact regional newspaper) and additional variables from population records is available under strongly restrictive rules at Statistics Netherlands.           
The questionnaires (both Dutch and English) used in this survey are available on www.dpes.nl. 
The 2010 data will become available in March 2012.

<###45266###>Erfgoed van de Oorlog, Bystander Memories, interview RG-50.570.0028 De geïnterviewde vertelt over zijn herinneringen als kind aan de Jodenvervolging in Assen. Hij gaat voornamelijk in op het weghalen van zijn buren, wat een diepe indruk op hem maakte. Tevens vertelt hij over het versturen van de afscheidsbriefjes die hij vond langs de spoorlijn. Joodse gevangenen op weg naar Polen gooiden deze uit de trein. Hij is als kind eveneens enkele malen in kamp Westerbork geweest, waar hij herinneringen aan ophaalt.                          
                         
The interviewee talks about his experiences as a child regarding the persecution of the Jews in the city of Assen (capital of the province of Drenthe, in the North-East of the Netherlands; the Westerbork concentration camp is also located in this province). His focusses mainly on the deportation of his neighbours, which made a big impression on him. He also talks about posting the farewell letters he found alongside the railway tracks. Jewish prisoners on their way to Poland threw them from the trains. As a child, the interviewee was also at the Westerbork concentration camp several times, and he also relates some of his memories of this.                         
                         

<###45210###>CONAMORE (Conflict and Management of Relationships) Adolescent study CONAMORE is an ongoing longitudinal study of Dutch adolescents that examines    
their personality and identity, their relationships with parents and peers as well as    
their emotional and behavioural states (Meeus et al., 2002). Between 2001 and    
2006 five annual waves have been conducted. From the first wave onwards, the    
sample was designed to contain two age cohorts, namely early and middle    
adolescents. The total adolescent sample consisted of 1,313 respondents and    
demonstrated a very small attrition (1% from wave 1 to wave 2, 2.6% from wave    
2 to wave 3, 1.4% from wave 3 to wave 4, 1% from wave 4 to wave 5). A group    
of 200 ethnic minority adolescents has been included in the sample.

<###46186###>Different times, different decisions? Lithic artefacts from Eemian Neumark-Nord 2/2 and Weichselian Neumark-Nord 2/0 (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) analyzed and compared This thesis gives a technological and typological description of part of the lithic artefacts coming from the Eemian site Neumark-Nord 2/2 and Weichselian site Neumark-Nord 2/0, Germany. Also a comparison between the two lithic assemblages is given. Explanations for possible differences are sought in Neanderthal behaviour, palaeoenvironmental parameters, excavation strategy and other post-depositional processes.
<###46258###>Project Circulation of Knowledge and learned practices in the 17th-century Dutch Republic. A web-based Humanities Collaboratory on Correspondences (Geleerdenbrieven) The scientific revolution of the 17th century was driven by countless discoveries in the observatory, at sea, in the workshop, in society at large and in the library. There was a dramatic increase in the amount of information, giving rise to new knowledge, theories and world images. The Dutch Republic played a key role in this information society avant la lettre. Its global trade network, its prosperity and its relative tolerance made the Republic a refuge for intellectuals from around Europe.

But how did the 17th-century scientific information system actually work? How were new elements of knowledge picked up, processed, disseminated and ultimately accepted in broad circles of the educated community? In short: how did knowledge circulate? The 17th-century Republic offers an ideal case for exploring the answers to this question, and correspondence between scholars is the ideal research subject. That is because until the publication of the first scientific journals in the 1660s, letters were by far the most direct and important means of communication between intellectuals. In order to answer the research question, a huge amount of such correspondence needs to be analyzed  systematically. Traditional research methods are inadequate, and for that reason a consortium of universities, research institutes and cultural heritage institutions built a multidisciplinary collaboratory to analyze a machine-readable and growing corpus starting with, but not limited to, the approximately 20,000 letters of scholars who lived in the Dutch United Provinces during the 17th century.

The consortium is in the process of building  the web-based tools to analyze and visualize the 17th-century epistolary  networks and their themes of interest, and to enrich this corpus with annotations. The collaboratory will not only contribute to our understanding of the circulation of knowledge in the 17th century, but also generate useful technologies for cross-disciplinary collaborations involving data-sharing and data enrichment in the Humanities. As such, this web-based Humanities collaboratory on correspondences is a valuable prototype for possible future research collaborations focusing on large, heterogeneous datasets.

<###48078###>Leiden Historical Population Databank 1700-1850, Kohier 1748 The MS-Access database KOHIER1748 is almost completely based on the archival source of the "Kohier van het Provisioneel Middel tot remplacant der afgeschafte pagten van 1748" (Regionaal Archief Leiden) of the city of Leiden made up in 1748. This tax assessment register contains data on the almost total population of Leiden in that year, including information on occupation, taxation, family composition, domestic servants, location in the city and poverty, on the level of all the heads of households. In fact, it can therefore be considered as one of the very rare local census registers of the city before 1800. The information from this source has been combined with that from the property tax register, "het verpondingskohier" of 1749. This dataset has been initiated by and created under the supervision of the late dr. H.A. Diederiks (Leiden University) starting in 1972. It has been modified later on several times. The original ASCII file (on punched cards) has been converted into a SPSS system file and in the late nineties into a MS Access file. During these transformations those fields which were originally coded have been "decoded". Those fields (like occupation) are now available in both coded and uncoded form.

Furthermore, the typological databases are separate datasets (see Relations).
<###48232###>The Typological Database System (TDS) Curator documentation The Typological Database System (TDS) is a web-based service that provides integrated access to a collection of independently created typological databases. It was developed with support from NWO grant 380-30-004 / INV-03-12 and from participating universities, and provides continued availability and extended documentation for its component databases, through a uniform structure and search interface. Web technologies evolve rapidly, and the system had begun to show its age even before the end of the project in 2009, motivating migration of the data collection to an archival platform. Through its Project Call 1, CLARIN-NL granted funding for migrating the resource to a durable, archival environment and converting it to a true web service architecture.

<###48275###>Recording the Future This project aims at documenting aspects of everyday life in Indonesia during the 21st century by creating an audiovisual archive that consists of recordings made in eight different places throughout the Indonesian archipelago. They are not a statistical representation of ‘Indonesia’, but open different windows on everyday life in Indonesia: the city, the provincial and harbor town, and rural, uphill, coastal and river areas. 

The project started in 2003. Each year recordings are made in two places over a period of ten days, which results in 25-30 hours of recordings. In four years eight places are documented, after which the camera returns to the first place. The systematic repetition of recordings will open up the possibility of making comparisons in order to measure change and continuity.

Recordings are made from a fixed spot, from the top of a car and during walks of 3-4 hours. During the walk the filmmakers stop to talk with people, usually beginning by asking them what they are doing. Every morning the headlines of available newspapers are filmed, to catch glimpses of national events, world news and local issues. In addition, a variety of themes and topics we are familiar with but tend to ignore in terms of documentation – a school class, Friday prayer at the mosque, a railway station etc. – is recorded. During the recordings a diary is kept in which decisions about locations, trajectories, themes, topics and persons are explained. The recordings are made without a prefabricated script. The archive will eventually consist of the original and unedited recordings, a catalogue, a diary and digital photos.

<###48391###>Status Attainment in the Netherlands 1811-1941 - Study 5 Societies have distinct social structures and individuals are positioned within the structure, or hierarchy, of the society. The broad consensus within social science is that an individual's position is partially ascribed by their social background and partially by their own achievements. The relative influence of social background and personal achievement remains an empirical question. in a society where social background is relatively more important it is plausible that an individual will attain a status position that is similar to their parents. Conversely, in a society where personal achievement is more influential it is plausible that a greater degree of discrepancy between status position and social background may be observed.

This study examines the extent to which macro level developments have been able to shift the relative importance of background and achievement for status attainment in the Netherlands during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The present thesis distinguishes six macro level developments that are sometimes referred to as 'modernization': industrialization, educational expansion, mass communication, mass transportation, urbanization and in-migration. For each of the developments hypotheses are derived on how they influence status attainment through marriage as well as intergenerational status attainment.
The hypotheses are tested using hierarchical linear analyses. Large scale individual level datasets are augmented with contextual data on each of the macro level developments. The approach taken provides new insights in spatial and temporal variation in the status attainment process. Moreover, it allows hypotheses on 'modernization' to be tested on their home ground: in a period before and during industrialization.

The soundings of the season of 2010 have resulted in a number of very important finds for our knowledge of the history of the site Satu Qala / Idu, albeit that they lacked archaeological context. However, their distribution over the tell makes it extremely probable that the palace from which the inscribed bricks derive can be located in the very summit.

<###48496###>Irrigation there is more to discover: Archaeological study in the territory of Gadara, Jordan This dissertation is the result of an Mphil study at Leiden University, the Netherlands. This study researches the irrigation systems in the ancient region of Gadara (modern day Umm Qays) in the north of Jordan. Knowledge of the region is derived form extensive archaeological remains and historical records. Judging by the present day water resources, agricultural soil quality and pastureland, the region of Gadara probably also had good agricultural potential during the Hellenistic, Roman an Byzantine periods (300 BC - AD 636). This view is supported by ancient remains of water channels and installations, which can be found in the landscape. Studying the irrigation systems in their archaeological, modern economic and social contexts, will enable a better understanding of the associated ancient societies.

The main subject of this thesis is the study of local irrigation systems in the north of Jordan. An ethnographic survey was executed and interesting information was collected. By studying the way a society operates and man behave it will be possible to find out how man currently manages water and how he uses it for his purpose. The researcher has adopted an approach of looking at the present irrigation systems with the intent to understand how they work nowadays and subsequently, in future studies, use this information to understand how irrigation systems worked in the past, especially when linked to past societies.

<###49061###>WageIndicator continuous web-survey on work and wages 2000 - (ongoing) The WageIndicator Survey is a continuous, multilingual, multi-country web-survey, counducted across 65 countries since 2000. The web-survey generates cross sectional and longitudinal data which might provide data especially about wages, benefits, working hours, working conditions and industrial relations. 
The survey has detailed questions about earnings, benefits, working conditions, employment contracts and training, as well as questions about education, occupation, industry and household characteristics.

Research Focus:
The WageIndicator Survey is a multilingual questionnaire and aims to collect information on wages and working conditions. As labour markets and wage setting processes vary across countries, country specific translations have been favoured over literal translations. The WageIndicator Survey includes regularly extra survey questions for project targeting specific countries, for specific groups or about specific events.
These projects usually address a specific audience (employees of a company, employees in an industry, readers of a magazine, members of a trade union or an occupational association, and alike). The data of the project questions are included in the dataset. 

Sample:
The target population of the WageIndicator is the labour force, that is, individuals in paid employment as well as job seekers. In addition to workers in formal dependent employment the survey aims to include apprentices, employers, own-account workers, freelancers, workers in family businesses, workers in the informal sector, unemployed workers, job seekers individuals who never had a job, as well as retired workers and housewifes school pupils or students with a job on the side and persons performing voluntary work. 
The WageIndicator data is derived from a volunteer survey, inviting webvisitors to the national WageIndicator websites to complete the web-survey. Annually, the websites receive millions of web-visitors.

Bias:
Non-Probability web based surveys are problematic because not every individual has the same probability of being selected into the survey. The probability of being selected depends on national or regional internet access rates and on numbers of visitors accessing the webiste. Data of such surveys form a convenience rather than a probability sample. Due to the non-probability based nature of the survey and its selectivity the obtained results cannot be generalized for the population of interest; i.e. the labor force.
Comparisons with representative studies found an underrepresentation of male labour force, part-timers, older age groups, and low educated persons. 
Besides other strategies to reduce the bias the WageIndicators provides different weighting schemes in order to correct for selection bias.

Data Characteristics:
The data is organised in annual releases. The data of the period 2000-2005 is released as one dataset. Each data release consists of a dataset with continuous variables and one with project variables. The continuous variables can be merged across years. All variable and value labels are in English. The data does not include the text variables and verbatims form open-ended survey questions, these are available in Excel-Format upon request.

Spatial Coverage:
The survey started in 2000 in the Netherlands. Since 2004, websites have been launched in many European countries, in North and South America and in countries in Asia. From 2008 on web sites have been launched in more African countries, as well as in Indonesia and in a number of post-Soviet countries.
For each country each, the questions have been translated. Multilingual countries employ multilingual questionnaires. Country-specific translations and locally accepted terminology have been favored over literal translations.

Rights: Due to the confidential character of the WageIndicator microdata, direct access to the data is only provided by means of research contracts. Access is in principle restricted to universities and research institutes.
<###49436###>The public’s opinion on the control of terrorism: Attitudes and willingness-to-pay In March 2010, the LISS panel completed a questionnaire on counter-terrorism measures. Half of the participating panel members was presented (traditional) attitudinal questions about measures to combat terrorism, while the other half was questioned about their willingness to pay for such measures. The four measures were presented to the panel members in random order. 

The questionnaire was fielded for a second time in March 2011.
<###49430###>Enrichment Experiment In March 2011, the LISS panel completed a questionnaire about impending data enrichment. This data enrichment means that CentERdata, in collaboration with Statistics Netherlands, may combine respondents’ answers in LISS questionnaires with information about the respondent known to Statistics Netherlands.    

This questionnaire aims to gain insight into how respondents can best be informed about this enrichment. To this end, first various emails and letters were sent to 745 panel members. These panel members were divided into four experimental groups:   

Group 1 = received brief text by email 
Group 2 = received brief text by letter
Group 3 = received extensive text by email 
Group 4 = received extensive text by letter   

This questionnaire investigates whether respondents have understood the information provided to them in the previously sent email or letter, and whether this notification affects the respondents’ attitude towards privacy issues. To research the latter aspect, a control group was selected consisting of 500 randomly chosen households (including all household members of age 16 and over). This control group was only presented the questions about privacy.

<###49434###>Self-Regulatory Orientation: Addressing a basic aspect of the self and its relation to social indicators and life-outcomes In February 2011, the LISS panel was presented a questionnaire with questions that capture self-regulation and 8 questions that capture individualism/collectivism to test the relationship of these psychological constructs with core social science constructs such as values, political attitudes, trust, and well-being (which are already in the LISS core questionnaires). In addition, 8 questions were asked to measure empathy, allowing for an investigation of the interplay of regulatory focus, empathy, and trust.

The questionnaires serve to validate the Dutch SF-6D and EQ-5D (classifications for describing health) and to understand the valuation of health in the Netherlands.  

For this purpose, the SF-6D questionnaire uses discrete choice experiments (pairwise comparisons). The EQ-5D is a shorter and simpler instrument than the SF-6D. Therefore, the EQ-5D questionnaire also examines the best way of posing the questions. For this purpose, pairwise comparisons and best-worst scaling are used (the evaluation of three health states simultaneously).
<###49439###>Civic Participation In May 2011 the LISS panel completed a questionnaire about voluntary activities and/or participation in activities within organizations. 

The questions presented to respondents were dependent on the total number of organizations that they had entered in the Social Integration and Leisure questionnaire (Wave 4). 

The structure of the questionnaire is explained extensively in the introduction of the codebook.
<###49432###>Initial Questionnaire The Initial Questionnaire is the first questionnaire administered to newly starting LISS panel members. Each month the questionnaire is available for new panel members. The datasets contain the response over an entire year.
<###49437###>The Impact of Style and Rhetoric on the Perception of Right-Wing Populist Leaders In February 2011, the questionnaire “National politics” was fielded in the LISS panel. This questionnaire examines the impact of style and rhetoric on the perception of right-wing populist leaders.
<###49446###>Using Anchoring Vignettes to Examine the Effect of Socioeconomic Status and Child Health This questionnaire concerns the way people with different socio-economic status respond to questions about child health.
<###49441###>Telephone use and regional elections In March 2011, the LISS panel completed the questionnaire “Telephone use and regional elections” (Dutch: telefoongebruik en verkiezingen Provinciale Staten).
<###49447###>Are Investors Driven by Sentiments? The principal aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the mood an investor is in when making decisions and the actual decisions.

In November the questionnaire was presented to 929 panel members, of which 879 completed the questionnaire and 118 indicated that they did not own stock investments [when answering the question “What is (approximately) the total value of the stock in your investment portfolio (against the most recent stock exchange prices)?”]. They were subsequently excluded from the rest of the questionnaire.   

A single question was repeated in December 2010, namely whether the respondent performed any stock transactions over the past month.   

In February 2011 the entire questionnaire was again presented to the selected panel members. A single question was repeated in March 2011. In June the questionnaire was repeated in its entirety for the last time; in July a single question was repeated again.
<###49444###>Left- and right-handedness This questionnaire examines finger length and the extent to which people are left- or right-handed.
<###49429###>Election Campaigns 2010 This project contains three studies. The first study is about the local elections of 2010. The second study is about the effect of the 2010 election campaigns on issue knowledge. The third study is about the national elections for the House of Representatives 2010.
<###49440###>Alcohol Use and Coping with Stress This questionnaire concerns the different experiences that people have in their lives with alcohol and stress. 

The first measurement was in January 2011. The second measurement was in April 2011 (among the same selection of the panel).
<###49481###>Belgium General Election Study 2003 Post-electoral Belgium General Election Study 2003. A random probability sample of voters of both communities (Francophone and Flemish Belgian) has been interviewed face to face in the months following up the federal elections of May 18, 2003. Sample size: 1213 in Flanders / 777 in Francophone Belgium with RR1 response rate of 64.5%

Following the first three Belgium National Election Studies, which were held after the General Election of November 24th, 1991, May 21st, 1995 and June 13th 1999, a fourth,and similar study was set up in connection with the General Election of May 18th, 2003.The Study was supported financially by the Belgium Federal Science Policy Office, under the National Ministry of Science. 
The Flemish part of the survey was conducted by the Institute of Social and Political Opinion Research at the Department of Sociology,Catholic University of Leuven. PIOP, Point d'appui Interuniversitaire sur l'Opinion Publique et la Politique at the Department of Political and Social Sciences, Catholic University of Louvain-La-Neuve, was responsible for the Francophone part of the study.Both research centres are supervised by a Steering Committee consisting of professors from the political research units of various Belgium universities.
<###49584###>Thematische collectie: LISS immigrant panel data - overview of available LISS Studies This LISS immigrant panel data is an addition to the general LISS panel.This immigrant panel has been in full operation since October 2010 and is comprised of around 1600 households (2400 individuals) of which 1100 households (1700 individuals) are of non-Dutch origin. 

The LISS panel has been founded by the CentERdata research institute in Tilburg, the Netherlands. Since 2007, the nearly 8.000 individuals in the panel complete various online questionnaires each month. Academic researchers can require access to these data at no cost after signing a statement concerning the use of the data.

Furthermore, the LISS panel can be used to collect one's own data. This is also cost-free for researchers at universities and scientific institutes. Researchers from the Netherlands and abroad are free to submit a survey proposal. Proposals can be very brief, can be submitted throughout the year, and will be reviewed within one to three months (see the website for guidelines).

Next to researchers’ own studies, the LISS Core Study is fielded in the panel every year, consisting of several modules on various themes such as work, education, health, family relations, social integration, leisure time, ethnicity, religion, income, assets, political views, values and personality. 

The LISS panel is specifically intended for scientific research. For this reason, the quality and the coverage of the sample is of prime concern. The panel is based on a traditional random sample drawn from the population registers. Persons not included in the original sample cannot participate, so there can be no self-selection. People without a computer or Internet connection are provided with equipment to participate by CentERdata. The quality and representativeness of the panel are monitored jointly with Statistics Netherlands.

<###49608###>Initial Questionnaire The Initial Questionnaire is the first questionnaire administered to newly starting LISS-I panel members. Each month the questionnaire is available for new panel members.
<###49605###>Health This survey is part of the LISS-I Core Study, a longitudinal study delivering a broad range of social core information about the panel members. The questionnaire focuses on health, health perception and health related to job situation.
<###49609###>Social contacts In August 2011, the LISS-I panel was presented a questionnaire about contacts with family, friends, neighbors and other acquaintances.
<###49607###>Values Questionnaire In April 2011, the Immigrants panel was presented a questionnaire on values. The values were measured by giving brief descriptions of persons and asking to what extent that person resembles the respondent. It applies to all descriptions in the questionnaire that, wherever reference is made to he/him/his, this can also be read as she/her/her.
<###49606###>Personality - Core Study This questionnaire is part of the LISS-I Core Study, a longitudinal survey delivering a broad range of social core information about the panel members. The survey focuses on personality and characteristics.
<###49604###>Religion and ethnicity This survey is part of the LISS-I Core Study, a longitudinal study delivering a broad range of social core information about the panel members. The questionnaire focuses on religion and ethnicity.
<###49599###>Background variables immigrant panel The demographics and other general characteristics of Immigrant panel households are measured every month using a separate questionnaire, known as the Household Box. For every Immigrant panel household, a single contact person completes this questionnaire. The Household Box needs to be completed when joining the panel, before the household can start completing other questionnaires. Thereafter, the contact person is presented the household box every month to enter any changes that may have occurred. From every field work period, a data file containing details from the household box is made available.
<###49630###>Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies - LISS Immigrant Panel The survey consists of questions from the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies.

In May 2010, the questionnaire of the Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies (NKO) was administered to the LISS-I panel. In June 2010, the second part was administered.
<###49631###>Operant Motive Test In September and October 2010, a questionnaire was administered to the Immigrant panel in which respondents were asked to answer three questions about six pictures (from 12 pictures in total). In September, it was randomly determined whether the respondent received picture 1 - 6 or picture 7 – 12. In October the respondent received the other six pictures. If a panelmember did not participate in September the order of the pictures was randomly determined in October (1 - 6 or 7 - 12).
<###49633###>Action Control Scale (ACS-90) In June 2010, the LISS-I panel completed the Action Control Scale (ACS-90) questionnaire with the aim of gaining insight into the effects of independent versus interdependent self-construal on the relationship between self-regulatory competence, self-access and well-being across cultures.  

The two (of the three) scales used here are:
a) Failure-related action orientation vs. preoccupation (AOF)
b) Decision-related action orientation vs. hesitation (AOD).
<###49632###>Solidarity in health care In December 2010, the Immigrant panel completed the questionnaire about solidarity in health care, with the aim of gaining insight into the public opninion concerning health care in the Netherlands.
<###49627###>Multiculturalism In August 2010, a questionnaire on multiculturalism was administered to the Immigrant panel to gain insight into the acculturation strategies of immigrants in the Netherlands.
<###49628###>Namegenerator (social networks) In August 2010, a questionnaire was administered to the LISS-I panel to gain insight into the social network of people (family members, friends, and acquaintances).
<###49629###>Trust In July 2010 (wave 1) a questionnaire about confidence in several institutions was administered to the Immigrant panel. In November 2010 (wave 2) the questionnaire was repeated.
<###49791###>Visual exploration of the attribute space of DANS EASY metadata Study of the metadata of the Electronic Archiving System (EASY) of Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) for the purpose of getting insight in the internal structure of the collection. The visualization contains a dump of the EASY metadata set and all important data files that were generated during this analysis and used for the interactive website. It contains metadata extracted from EASY version I (before January 1, 2012) and from EASY II (extracted January 20th, 2012).
<###49793###>Who are the users of a video search system? Classifying a heterogeneous group with a Profile Matrix Formulating requirements for a video search system can be a challenging task when everyone is a possible user. This paper explores the possibilities of classifying users by creating a Profile Matrix, placing users on two axes: experience and goal-directedness. This enables us to describe the characteristics of the subgroups and investigate differences between the different groups. 
We created Profile Matrices by classifying 850 respondents of a survey regarding a requirements study for a video search system. We conclude that the Profile Matrix indeed enables us to classify subgroups of users and describe their characteristics. The current research is limited to descriptions of subgroups and analysis of differences between these subgroups. In the future, we want to research what these differences mean with regard to the users’ performance and acceptance of a video search system and explore the use of a profile matrix for other types of search systems.
<###49840###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 01, Regina Zielinski Interview with Regina Zielinski (Siedliczcze 2 September 1924). Zielinski was taken to Sobibor in a horse-drawn cart together with her fellow-villagers just before Christmas 1942. She was selected to knit socks and later had to sort ammunition. On arrival in the camp she heard her little brother say: ‘Let’s say farewell to the night, because we won’t see the sun rise again.’

She was born Riwka Feldman. After the uprising she fled by train to Frankfurt am Main where she worked for a German family as a domestic help. She pretended to be a Polish catholic girl. On 24 December 1945 she married a catholic Polish man in Wetlar under the assumed name of Wojciszyn. On 3 August 1949 the couple emigrated to Australia where they settled in Sydney.
<###49890###>Typological Database System Curator The Typological Database System (TDS) offers integrated access to various typological databases.

<###50094###>Measuring Monographs In the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), the monograph is an important means of communicating scientific results. As in the field of STM, the value of scholarly output needs to be assessed. This is done by bibliometric measures and qualitative methods. Bibliometric measures based on articles do not function well in the field of HSS, where monographs are the norm. The qualitative methods which take into account several stakeholders are labour intensive and the results are dependent on self-assessment of the respondents, which may introduce bias. In the case of humanities, the picture becomes even less clear due to uncertainties about the stakeholders. 
This dataset consists of over 25,000 downloads by more than 1,500 providers, spread over 859 monographs.
<###50156###>Evolution of Wikipedia Categories Knowledge Space Lab: Design versus Emergence. Comparison between the structure and evolution of categories in the Wikipedia and the Universal Decimal Classification. 2009-2011. 

Background:
This research has been conducted by the project "Knowledge Space Lab - mapping knowledge interactively". Funded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences - KNAW, from September 2009 - March 2011 [Strategiefondsproject KNAW - Amsterdam - The Netherlands] the project contributed to the new research area of mapping and modelling of science. The project addressed the difference between representing scholarly knowledge in (external) classification systems (such as thesauri, ontologies, bibliographic systems) and 'internal' representations based on data- and user-tagging (such as network analysis, user annotations/tagging, folksonomies).
<###50496###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 14, Thomas Blatt Interview with Thomas Blatt (Izbica 15 April 1927). Blatt arrived in Sobibor by truck on 23 April 1943. He escaped the gas chamber because a guard spotted him among the women and children and said: "Du Kleiner, komm mal ‘raus".

In the camp he had to help strengthen the fencing, later he had to sort and burn documents. After his escape he was shot by a Polish farmer and he wandered through the surrounding forest until the liberation. The bullet remained lodged in his lower jaw for the rest of his life. After the war he moved to Santa Barbara in California.
<###50495###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 13, Stephan Stelmaszuk and Tadeus Syczuk Interview with Stephan Stelmaszuk (Nidzia 1928) and Tadeus Syczuk (Dorohucza 1923).

Stelmaszuk and his family lived about four kilometres away from Sobibor. Sometimes he could smell the stench of burned bodies. His mother gave food to two survivors of the uprising. He knew little about the camp, because ‘all you saw was a fence around it’.

Syczuk, a railway employee, witnessed abuse and mass destruction. He heard people crying and screaming, an engine starting: ‘It lasted fifteen minutes and that was it.’
<###50483###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 03, Samuel Lerer Interview with Samuel Lerer (Zolkiewka 1 October 1922). Lerer was one of the first prisoners to arrive in Sobibor. He was ordered to look after the horses and this gave him access to much of the camp. During the uprising both his brothers were killed. Etched in his mind is ‘how my father went to the gas chamber naked’.

In the camp he also had to fatten up ducks for SS officer Frenzel. After the war in Berlin he and Esther Raab exposed SS officer Bauer, the operator of the gas engine. Samuel Lerer moved to Brooklyn in the United States, where he worked as a taxi driver. He is currently living in Marlboro, New Jersey USA and has survived to know two children, four grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and one on the way.
<###50487###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 07, Schlomo Alster Interview with Schlomo Alster (Chelm 1 December 1908). Alster was a carpenter and in Sobibor he had to help build barracks. He explained to new arrivals: ‘That is the fire, those are the people who just arrived.’ After the uprising he joined the partisans.

In 1936 Schlomo Alster married Hanna Grindberg. Not long after that their first child was born, followed by the second two years later. When they were three and five years old the Germans killed them and their mother. In Sobibor Schlomo Alster was not only a carpenter; he was also put to work on the Bahnhof-kommando. In 1946 he settled in Rehovot, Israel. Schlomo Alster passed away in March 1992.
<###50409###>PoliticalMashup 1814-2012 A mashup is a web application that combines data from more than one source into an integrated experience.  This political mashup  brings together political information produced by Dutch political parties (their promises and actions:  election manifestos, party websites, parliamentary proceedings) and as well  information on the reception of political promises and actions (news as well as user generated content from blogs, discussion for and comments on news items).  This political mashup  enables  novel historical research, creates challenging opportunities for computational linguists, and offers valuable and innovative testing-grounds for information retrieval researchers. The PoliticalMashup dataset comprises of all  parliamentary proceedings of the Dutch Parliament and Senate from 1814 until april 2012.

For related datasets see the thematic collection: 'PoliticalMashup and Dutch parliamentary proceedings 1814-2012'. You can find a link to this collection under 'Relations'.
<###50486###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 06, Jules Schelvis Interview with Jules Schelvis (Amsterdam 7 January 1921). Schelvis was put on transport from Westerbork on 1 June 1943 with his wife and in-laws. He brought his guitar as a ‘welcome distraction to take our mind off things’. On arrival in Sobibor he managed at the last moment to join a group of men who were selected for labour in the peat camp of Dorohucza. Jules Schelvis was one of the eighteen Dutch Jews who survived Sobibor.
<###50494###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 12, Arkady Wajspapir Interview with Arkady Wajspapir (1921). Wajspapir served as a sergeant in the Red Army and was injured in September 1941. As a Jewish prisoner of war he and the other Soviet soldiers had to build barracks in Lager IV in Sobibor. It quickly dawned on him that ‘the only way out of there was to escape’.

Before he was drafted into the Red Army Arkady Wajspapir worked as an engineer. After his recovery in a field hospital in Kiev he was transported to Minsk as a POW. On 22 September 1943 he, Petsjerski and other soldiers, arrived in Sobibor. After the war he returned to his old profession of engineer in the town of Donetzk.
<###50493###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 11, Chaskiel Menche Interview with Chaskiel Menche (Kolo 7 January 1910). Menche arrived in Sobibor in the summer of 1942 and he was briefly put to work in the sorting barracks. He was then appointed to shine shoes and make caps. Together with others he prepared a plan to murder Himmler during a visit to the camp. His desire for revenge was fulfilled when he stabbed a guard during the uprising: ‘My heart is lighter now for I stood in his blood’.

He grew up in a closed Jewish community and spoke mainly Yiddish. In 1937 he married Hella Podchlebnik. His wife and child were killed in Sobibor. During his escape the Germans shot him in the leg. Chaskiel Menche settled in Melbourne where he died in 1984.
<###50491###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 10, Esther Raab Interview with Esther Raab (Chelm 11 June 1922). Raab, together with Regina Zielinski and Hella Weiss, was taken to Sobibor just before Christmas 1942 in a horse-drawn cart. They saw such atrocities that she sometimes thought that ‘going to the gas chambers was easier than being exposed to all the horror’. After her escape she went into hiding on a farm where she was reunited with her long lost brother.

She was born Ester Terner. Shortly after the German occupation started her father was shot and killed while on his way to Belzec extermination camp. Esther Raab was forced to help reclaim a river in Siedliczcze. When she arrived in Sobibor on 22 December 1942 she and seven other girls from her transport were put to work in the knitting room.
<###50485###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 05, Kurt Thomas Interview with Kurt Thomas (Brno 11 April 1914). Thomas was taken to Sobibor via the ghetto of Theresienstadt. In the sorting barracks he had to sort clothes and belongings of victims who had been gassed. As an orderly he later managed to save the lives of several prisoners by letting them rest longer than allowed. When he had climbed across the fence during the uprising he refused to hurry: ‘I don’t have to run anymore, I am a free man’.

Born Kurt Ticho, he attended grammar school in his hometown. He served as a telegraph operator in the Czech army. After the war he saw to it that SS Frenzel was arrested in Berlin. Kurt Thomas died on 8 June 2009 in Columbus, Ohio.
<###50480###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 02, Alexander 'Sasja' Petsjerski Interview with Alexander ‘Sasja’ Petsjerski (Kremenchuk, 22 February 1909). Petsjerski was a lieutenant in the Red Army, was taken prisoner in the autumn of 1941. When a medical examination revealed he was Jewish, he was transported to Sobibor on 22 September 1943. Over a period of three weeks he drew up a detailed plan to escape from the camp with all the prisoners. About his captivity and his part in the uprising he said: ‘It is not just a memory, I live it’.

Before the war Alexander Petsjerski was an organization expert with a great love of the theatre and music. He was married and had a daughter when he enlisted in the army. In January 1990 he died in his hometown of Rostov-on-Don.
<###50489###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 09, Meier Ziss Interview with Meier Ziss (Lublin 15 November 1927). Ziss arrived in Sobibor in June 1942. At first he worked as a barber, later he became ‘Brandmeister’ and had to burn the documents left behind by the people who had just arrived on a transport. In the camp he heard that his parents had been killed and he ‘wanted to be dead together with them’. When he joined the partisans after the uprising he felt free and happy again. ‘There I was a human being.’ 

Meier Ziss grew up in Hrubiszow. After the war he went via Italy to Venezuela where he lived from 1956 to 1961. After that he went to Israel where he worked as an electronics dealer. It is unknown whether Meier Ziss is alive today.
<###50484###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 04, Stanislaw Szmajzner Interview with Stanislaw Szmajzner (Pulawy 13 March 1927). Szmajzner arrived in Sobibor at age fifteen. He was a goldsmith and had to make signet rings and other jewellery for the guards. During the uprising he managed to get hold of three rifles wrapped in blankets. He shot one of the Ukrainian guards in the watchtower: ‘That was the first time in my life I fired a gun’.

Apart from making gold jewellery Stanislaw Szmajzner had to check the prams that came in with the transports. He was also the foreman of the maintenance mechanics. After the uprising he joined the partisans. In 1947 he emigrated to Brazil. At the police station in Sao Paulo he recognized Gustav Wagner, who committed suicide not much later.

She worked in the laundry, had to knit socks and gloves and she tended to the flower garden. About her time in the camp she remembers: ‘They tormented us terribly’.

After her escape she fought with the partisans and in the Soviet army. She received six decorations, including the ‘Red Star’. An injury landed her in a field hospital. After the war she married a Czech man with whom she ran a wayside restaurant in Israel. Hella Weiss died in December 1988 in Gedera.
<###50498###>Sobibor Interviews, interview 15, Bernard Weber Interview with Bernard Weber (Lemberg 25 March 1922). Weber survived Auschwitz-Birkenau where he witnessed the uprising in crematorium B. For several months he worked in the Sonderkommando that had to burn dead bodies: ‘Day and night the fire burned four, five metres above the chimney’.
<###50534###>Nationaal Kiezersonderzoek, 2010  - NKO 2010 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study 2010 (DPES/NKO 2010)
 
The Dutch Parliamentary Election Studies (DPES) are a series of national surveys carried out under the auspices of the Dutch Electoral Research Foundation (SKON). These surveys have been conducted since 1970. Many questions are replicated across studies, although each has questions not asked in the others. The major substantive areas consistently covered include the respondents' attitudes toward and expectations of the government and its effectiveness in both domestic and foreign policy, the most important problems facing the people of the Netherlands, the respondents' voting behavior and participation history, and his/her knowledge of and faith in the nation's political leaders. The data for the DPES 2010 were collected by Statistics Netherlands and by Henk van der Kolk, Kees Aarts, and Jean Tillie on behalf of the SKON. The study has been made possible by grants from Statistics Netherlands, the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) and the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), and the Department of Political Science and Research Methodology, University of Twente. In order to provide the funding agencies with essential information about the use of the data that have been collected with their assistance, each user of the data is expected to send two copies of each completed and published manuscript to the distributor of the data. 

Number of cases: 2621, number of variables 639 

A version including all variables of this survey, including variables that were dropped for reasons of privacy protections (municipality, day of birth etc.) and additional variables from population records is available under strongly restrictive rules at Statistics Netherlands.
<###50610###>Origin and Early History of the Medieval Centre Helmond. A synthesis of the Archaeological Data Samenvatting Odyssee project
Based on archaeological data can be shown that Helmond is a late Medieval Created City. The city foundation may be related to the powerful politics of the Duke of Brabant and took place in the immediate vicinity of an existing settlement, called the Hague. At the end of the twelfth century, on the outskirts of the Hague nearby the river valley of the Aa, a for the northwest of Europe exceptional wooden castle was build. A series of very rare archaeological finds from the excavation of this swamp castle (for example bone and ivory chess pieces) can be related to the residence of Maria van Brabant, daughter of the Duke of Brabant and widow of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, also widow of the Count of Holland. She was Lady of Helmond, and by her doing around 1240 the monastery Binderen was founded, just north of the centre of Helmond. Since 1980, through excavations by amateur archaeologists and professional archaeologists much archaeological data were gathered both inside and around the current centre. From most excavations a basis report conform the current mandatory basis reporting legislation is missing. At present, the municipality of Helmond invested heavily in a large project to produce basic archaeological reports, that will be available during 2010. The investment totals € 150,000,- , of which approximately € 75,000,- will be used for elaborate excavations in and around the Medieval town (and c. € 75,000,- will be used for archaeological projects from prehistoric and Roman periods). Within the currently available additional resources of the municipality of Helmond a synthesis concerning Origin and Early History of the Medieval Centre Helmond is not provided. This application seeks a scientific synthesis report on archaeological research in and around the Medieval town Centre of Helmond. The results of such a synthesis will be compared with the results of archaeological and historical research on urban and rural areas of Eindhoven which is currently performed under the NWO program "Town and Countryside: The Dynamic Symbiosis" of the research Urbanization City & Culture (period 2006-2010). The synthesis of Archaeological investments from Helmond will be translated into a scientific report, a public-friendly book, a website and an exhibition at the City Museum of Helmond.
<###50772###>Threatening communication: a critical re-analysis and a revised meta-analytic test of fear appeal theory Despite decades of research, consensus regarding the dynamics of fear appeals remains elusive. A meta-analysis was conducted that was designed to resolve this controversy. Publications that were included in previous meta-analyses were re-analysed, and a number of additional publications were located. The inclusion criteria were full factorial orthogonal manipulations of threat and efficacy, and measurement of behaviour as an outcome. Fixed and random effects models were used to compute mean effect size estimates. Meta-analysis of the six studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria clearly showed a significant interaction between threat and efficacy, such that threat only had an effect under high efficacy (d = 0.31), and efficacy only had an effect under high threat (d = 0.71). Inconsistency in results regarding the effectiveness of threatening communication can likely be attributed to flawed methodology. Proper tests of fear appeal theory yielded the theoretically hypothesised interaction effect. Threatening communication should exclusively be used when pilot studies indicate that an intervention successfully enhances efficacy.
<###50914###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 07 Mary Richheimer-Leyden van Amstel Mary Richheimer was a little girl of two and a half years old when her parents handed her over to foster parents for hiding. She was treated badly, not only in her first foster family, but also by the Jewish Cohens after the war. Mary never assumed the family name of Cohen but always called herself named Leijden van Amstel, after her parents who were killed in Sobibor.

Mary didn't know anything about her parents: she has only one picture of her mother and even nothing at all of her father. The only surviving aunt, a sister of her mother, did not want to talk about her family. Mary always felt a great loss. At all the important moments of life her parents and all relatives she never knew were absent. Still a young girl she began working as a nurse and this is how she met her husband, Guus Richheimer. They founded a family and have four children together.

The file with the complete interview as well as a file with the transcription of the interview is available in EASY after permission from Selma Leydesdorff.

<###51212###>CroMe interview 2 with Kata Sertic Kata Sertić was born in Saborsko, on September 26, 1959. During the Second World War a lot of men from Saborsko were in the ustashe army, a lot of people from the village were killed or ended up in Bleiburg. Some members of Kata Sertić's family were in the ustashe army as well.  Before the Homeland War she had been  working as a radiology engineer in Slovenia.  In 1988 she moved to  Sarajevo with her daughter and husband. At the time when the war started in Croatia, she was working at  the Radiology Institute of the Koševo hospital. She left Bosnia in 1991 and came back to  Croatia. She started to work as  a nurse in the Ogulin hospital. When the Croatian army established its own medical service, she stayed in the medical service on Kapela, at the battlefield.  She had been  in the army until 1996. Today, she lives in Saborsko.
<###51245###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 04  Marco (Marcus) de Groot Marco de Groot was born in 1939 in Amsterdam and grew up there. He still has recollections of his parents, who were rounded up. His heavily pregnant mother was betrayed and taken away from the hiding place where she and her son Marco were staying at the time; at that very moment little Marco was playing at the neighbours. Marco's father, who was also in hiding, tried to find another hiding place in Amsterdam for him.
From August 1944 onwards Marco lived in Rustenburgerstraat with people who cared for him but were in a bad marriage themselves. He stayed with them after the war. When his foster parents divorced, Marco followed his father, who had a new wife and family. He did not feel at home here and left his parents as soon as he could. Despite his mental health problems, caused by his past experiences, Marco managed to build a new life. He made a career with "Hollandse Lloyd", founded two businesses, and married Riet. Together they have a daughter and a son. Both Marco’s father and his mother were killed in Sobibor.

<###51244###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 03 Pim (Constance) Combrink-Van Huizen Constance (Pim) Combrink-van Huizen was born in Velsen. In 1939, after her parents were divorced, Constance, her Jewish mother, and her four and a half year older sister moved to Huizen. One evening they were rounded up and transported to Westerbork; the two sisters were released soon because they were half-Jewish, but Constance's mother was deported to Sobibor, where she was killed upon arrival.
Constance, although half-Jewish, went into hiding with a friend of her mother and her two sons in Bussum. Later she came into the family of "uncle" Wim and "aunt" Toos and their three children in Santpoort. She kept house here and stayed until a year after the war. On Dolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday) her father, a member of the NSB movement and in search of her whereabouts, left for Germany, and from that moment onwards Constance felt freeer. Constance Combrink-van Huizen had five years of primary school education but was not able to go to school during the war. After the liberation she cherished hopes for her mother's return for many years.

<###51242###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 01 Louis van Velzen Louis lived with his father and mother, his little brother, and a sister of his grandfather who kept house in Jodenbreestraat in Amsterdam. His father and grandfather sold carpets, his mother paintings, mainly in Monnickendam and Volendam. Louis has many recollections of Jewish life in his neighbourhood. He lived in hiding at several addresses.
Because of his circumcision Louis found he looked different from other boys and tried to find ways of reversing it. He then had to spend six months in a hospital that also treated German troops. 
His father soon arrived in Westerbork, and at first was treated well there. His mother wanted to be with her husband and in the end both were deported to Sobibor together. After the war Louis was taken away from a nice foster family and taken in by people who didn't really care about him. Louis asked his legal guardian to be placed in a Jewish boy's orphanage. In later years he became so disillusioned that he left for Australia for a while. Back in the Netherlands he found work in the Jewish funeral business. He had a stone placed at the Sobibor memorial site for his parents, who never had a proper funeral. Louis van Velzen lives with Lies.

<###51243###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 02 Lotty (Charlotte) Huffener-Veffer Lotty Huffener was born in Tugelaweg in Amsterdam and enjoyed a cosy childhood. Her mother came from a large family, her grandparents lived close by. The family loved making music, they sang together regularly, Lotte's seven year older sister played the violin and she herself the piano. The first concert she attended at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, conducted by Willem Mengelberg, was an event she would never forget.
Lotty wanted to read French language and literature, but had to learn a profession first. Having graduated from secondary school (ULO) and domestic science school, she worked as a diamond cutter. At the beginning of the war she tried to flee from the Netherlands together with her fiancé, but failed and was rounded up with her parents and sister. For more than one and a half years Lotty Huffener stayed in Konzentrationslager Herzogenbusch (Kamp Vught), where the Nazis planned to establish a diamond cutting factory. On 7 June, 1943 her parents and her sister Carla were deported to Sobibor with the infamous Kindertransport. Lotte worked for Philips in Kamp Vught and witnessed horrible things. After a short stay in Auschwitz she arrived in Reichenbach, where she was forced to work for Telefunken. At the end of the war Lotty, together with thousands of others, was forced to participate in a death march. Out of her large family only a niece and nephew survived the war.
<###51263###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 05 David van Huiden David van Huiden grew up in Amsterdam. His father died before his birth and when David was seven year old his mother remarried with the son of the chief rabbi of Groningen. The liberal Jewish family moved from the Concertgebouw district to Amsterdam Oost. For the children changes were far-reaching as their stepfather was a conservative Judaist.

During the comprehensive Amsterdam roundup of 20 June 1943 David's parents got the idea of having David walk the dog in order to evade detention. Although the place was bristling with policemen David managed to reach friends of his stepfather's in another part of Amsterdam. During the rest of the war he was in hiding with two Frisian families. David's mother, stepfather, and sister were rounded up and murdered in Sobibor. David was taken in by a German Jewish family after the war. Toward the end of the fifties he met his wife, Liesbeth. Together they have two sons.

<###51264###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 06 Ellen van der Spiegel Cohen Ellen van der Spiegel Cohen was a baby of four months when her parents put her into hiding. Through an intermediary Ellen found a home with the family of teacher Van der Spiegel. Both her parents were killed in Sobibor. Nobody from her father's side - out of a large family of over eighty - survived the war; two aunts from her mother's side did, but most sisters and brothers of her mother were killed in Sobibor too, as well as a niece and a nephew. All four of her grandparents perished in Auschwitz. Ellen has always kept the clothes in which her mother dressed her before handing her over.
Ellen was raised as a Christian and for a long time thought she was the only Jewish orphan in the world. At a later age she got more and more interested in her Jewish background and got into closer touch with her relatives, also in Israel. Her family name combines the name of her foster parents and the name of her father. Ellen van der Spiegel Cohen worked, among other things, as a psychologist.
<###51304###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 09 Jan Goedel Jan Goedel was born in Amsterdam but his first recollections are from his hiding in Friesland. Known as Jantje Visser from Rotterdam, he had a good life with the Frisian Osinga family, where he stayed for about three years. In 1946 Jan was transferred to two ladies living in Ede, with whom his youngest brother had been in hiding. From that moment on his name was Jan Baljet. This family took him in rather lovelessly.
Only when Jan went to secondary school (MULO) he was told that he was a Jewish boy and that his parents had passed away. The issue was not discussed further. Contacts with his two younger brothers have not been good since. In 1978, by sheer chance, Jan came into touch with his war brothers and his war foster mother. By that time he was on health leave, mainly because his early childhood had never been a subject of discussion - his only aunt having left him just one family picture. Ten years later, when in Yad Vashem, he found that his parents had been killed in Sobibor. Together with his wife, his two children and his grandchildren Jan has managed to build his life, living it according to his motto, "You may fall on your face as many times as you like, as long as you stand up just one time more. And that's what I try to do every time."

<###51346###>A suite of models to support the quantitative assessment of spread in pest risk analysis In the frame of the EU project PRATIQUE (KBBE-2007-212459 Enhancements of pest risk analysis techniques) a suite of models was developed to support the quantitative assessment of spread in pest risk analysis. This dataset contains the model codes (R language) for the four models in the suite. Three versions of the code are provided, differing in grid and spatial extent: (1) a decimal degree grid version for Europe; (2) a metric grid version for Europe and (3) a decimal degree grid version for other parts of the world. Usage of the code is described in the “Tutorial on the generic spread models“. 

Case studies were conducted with the decimal degree version, using European maps of climate suitability and presence of host or habitat for seven species: (1) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, (2) Anoplophora chinensis, (3) Anoplophora glabripennis, (4) Eichhornia crassipes; (5) Meloidogyne enterolobii, (6) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus / Monochamus, (7) Gibberella circinata.

<###51337###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 11 Philip Jacobs Philip Jacobs was born youngest of three children. He graduated as a pharmacist at the beginning of the war. Early in 1942 he fled alone to Southern France, and arrived via Curaçao in Canada, where he enrolled in the Royal Air Force. He served in the occupational force in Germany. After his return to the Netherlands he found out that his parents, sister, and girlfriend had been killed in Sobibor.

Philip completed his studies after the war and then worked as a hospital pharmacist in Rotterdam. He visited Auschwitz and Sobibor several times. He acted as a co-plaintiff at the Demjanjuk trial because, among other reasons, he felt the need to meet one of the murderers of his loved ones face to face, but also because he felt that he should not neglect his duty to act as a witness. Philip is the widower of Tinie Rottenberg, whom he first met at the Jewish Youth Federation. Philip Jacobs has three sons and five granddaughters.
<###51338###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 12  Martin (Martijn) Haas Martin (Martijn) Haas was born in Breda, where he spent his childhood together with his two sisters, Liesje (Elisabeth) and Roosje, and his brother Isaac. He is from a well-to-do family. The youngest children, Roosje and Martijn, went into hiding with two Catholic families and survived the war. The other members of the family were killed: mother, Liesje, and Isaac in Sobibor, father in Auschwitz.
After the war Martin was adopted by a cousin of his father and his wife, the Oudkerk family in Amsterdam. The three of them emigrated to Nahariya in Israël in 1950; Martin graduated as an engineer here. Later he moved to America with his wife, also a survivor. There he studied biophysics and pursued a scientific career; together they have three children. After his divorce he married with An.
 
Martin feels it is his mission as a sole survivor to defend, acknowledge, and remember his perished relatives.
<###51342###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 13 Nathan (Nikki) Hakker Nathan (Nikki) Hakker survived the war because in the train to Westerbork his mother handed him over to a family who were in the possession of documents by which they could be exchanged with prisoners from Israel. Nathan's mother was deported farther shortly after arrival in Westerbork, and was gassed in Sobibor on July 1, 1943. His father arrived already earlier at Mauthausen. Together with his 'new' family Nathan ended up in Bergen-Belsen, from where he was forwarded to Tröbitz at the end of the war.

After the war until he was twelve years old he lived with a Jewish aunt who had come out of Auschwitz branded for life. He had an unpleasant childhood, he felt lonely and let down. From his twelveth year on he passed through several transit houses, boys' homes, and foster families. His childhood experiences were to have a great impact on his later life. Today Nathan Hakker is married and has three children.
<###51365###>Functional projections in analytic languages The data were collected in the context of an NWO project (2008-2012) in which Sinitic languages were compared with Kwa-languages. The data are all sentences from languages belonging to these language families.

The ultimate aim of the project is to find out whether there are such things as "analytic languages" and, if so, whether the nature of such languages has anything to do with the nature of the functional categories they realize or with the way they realize them.

<###51419###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 15  Jaap (Jack) Polak Jaap Polak was born in Amsterdam. He cherishes recollections of his loving parents. His father was very much involved in the Zionist movement in the Netherlands, and the Polak children were raised in a Zionist spirit. Jaap didn't go into hiding, although he had the opportunity to do so. He felt that as a strong young man he would be able to get through the work camps.

He was married when the war broke out, but in Westerbork he met his current wife, Ina, whom he married after the war. Together they published the book "Steal a pencil for me" about the love letters they wrote each other in Westerbork and Bergen-Belsen. Almost all of Jaap's relatives from father's side perished, and not more than three uncles and aunts from mother's side survived the Second World War. Jaap's parents were killed in Sobibor, his eldest sister perished in Bergen-Belsen. Jaap gives lectures on the Shoah for young audiences.
<###51420###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 16  Rudie Cortissos Rudie Cortissos was interviewed twice: once before, and once after the
trial. The interviews are put one after another in the transcript.

Salomon (Salo) Cortissos was not yet three years old when he was taken to the first of a series of hiding adresses. At the end of 1941 his parents took him to a brother of his father, who was in a mixed marriage. A little later he came into the Poort family; his "father-in-hiding" acting as substitute manager for his grandfather's business.
For safety reasons he was now named Rudie: Rudie Poort. His blond hair and blue eyes came in handy. Still later he was taken in by the family of the sister of the servant-girl who had worked for his parents before the war. He visited a Christian elementary school and from time to time saw his grandparents from his father's side, who were in hiding in the neighbourhood. By the end of 1944 Rudie had moved to his final hiding address, with Greta Knuyt in Parnassusweg. His father had been there as well, for one and a half year, hiding in between a floor and a ceiling, but Rudie found out about this only in January or February 1945. Both Rudie and his father survived the war; his mother was rounded up and murdered in Sobibor. After the war Rudie, his father, and Greta Knuyt moved to Minervalaan. In 1949 his father remarried a Czechoslovak woman whom he had met on a business trip, and Rudie's former "hiding-mother" disappeared abruptly from his life. He never had warm contacts with his stepmother. Rudie Cortissos married in 1961 and has two children as well as four grandchildren.
<###51567###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 18 Rudi Westerveld Rudi Westerveld was born Jaap Rudolf Isaac by the end of 1942. His parents were summoned to Westerbork when he was five months old. Rudi was then sent into hiding with an Austrian friend of his mother's, while his parents were forwarded to Sobibor and gassed there.
Rudi was unaware of his past during childhood and had a care-free youth. He learned of his background only gradually.
 By the time he went to university he had himself adopted officially.
Rudi studied engineering in Delft and after graduation stayed there for another forty years teaching. Within this period, Rudi worked as a development-aid worker in Mozambique for nearly five years, assisting at the upcoming telecommunication revolution. In Mozambique he also met his current wife, Monique. They have a son together.
<###51571###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 19 Max Degen Max Degen was born on the Nieuwe Achtergracht in Amsterdam. As a little baby he was taken by his parents to a Jewish uncle and a non-Jewish, German aunt, to safeguard him against deportation. His parents and his three-year old brother were deported and killed in Sobibor. Max was taken away from his uncle and aunt and taken to the kindergarten opposite the "Hollandse Schouwburg." A resistance group managed to smuggle him away from there.
Max was housed in the safe and loving environment of a reformed family, where he grew up after the war as well. He was aware of his Jewish origins, but at home this was almost a non-issue. His foster parents didn't pursue a higher education for him, and Max eventually made a career in the transportation sector. He lived for a period in Germany while with the Dutch Air Force and enjoyed his stay there.Because of his past he suffered from mental health problems for a while. Jewry and Jewish religion came to life for him at a higher age. Max plays an active role in the "war community" and during the interview recalls how he experiences the Demjanjuk trial.
Max Degen is married with Lutie, they have two sons and five grandchildren.
<###51535###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 17 Jules Schelvis Jules Schelvis was deported from Westerbork to Sobibor together with his wife and family-in-law on June 1, 1943. Unsuspectingly, he took with him his guitar. Jules stayed in the Sobibor extermination camp for a few hours, but was then transferred to the Dorohucza labour camp to cut peat there. After a short stay in this camp he managed to get sent to another labour camp in Lublin as member of a team of printers. In August 1944, having stayed for months in the Radom ghetto and subsequently in Szkolna camp, he arrived in a labour camp not far from Vaihingen. Here, together with thousands of others, he had to participate in construction work at an underground airplane plant. After this, he worked in still another labour camp in Southern Germany. He was suffering from typhus when he was liberated in April 1945.

The importance of not forgetting urged Jules Schelvis in 1999 to initiate the Sobibor Foundation. His wife and family-in-law were murdered in Sobibor. He published the story of his life, "Within the Gates," in the eighties, and the scientific study, "Sobibor Extermination Camp," in 1993. Jules was married with Jo for 53 years and has two children.
<###51587###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 20 Vera de Jong-Simons Vera Simons was one year old jaar when the war broke out. When she was taken into hiding by a foster family she was two and a half, almost three years old. An uncle of her father's, who lived in Amsterdam, had a mixed marriage; Vera survived the war with his wife's sister, who was an observing catholic, in Maastricht. She has good recollections from this hiding period. She was baptized after the war and still later was taken unexpectedly to the sister of her war foster mother and her father's uncle in Amsterdam. She was about six years old at the time and wasn't explained anything.
Although she remembers this father's uncle warmly, unpleasant times begin at her legal guardians in Amsterdam. Vera and her foster mother didn't really like each other. Her guardian died in 1951 and before long Vera was told that she was Jewish and didn't have any parents anymore. Little by little Vera broke away from her guardian, with whom she had emigrated to Australia against her own will. Vera found out that her guardian had robbed her and sold her heritage. Back in Amsterdam Vera met her future husband, John. They got two children and moved to Brussels. Both Vera’s parents were killed in Sobibor.
<###51603###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 21 Paul Hellmann Paul Hellmann was born March 6, 1935 in Rotterdam. Paul's father loved animals and the family of three lived in a house with a lot of pets. Paul's mother was half-Jewish; she had Russian Jewish father and a mother from Groningen, the Netherlands. His Jewish father had two Austrian Jewish parents, was raised in Austria and had come to the Netherlands at an older age. During the war the family members hid seperately. His mother went into hiding in Bilthoven and Amsterdam, was rounded up and deported to Auschwitz. Paul was in hiding in Ede, his father not far away from him in Lunteren. Paul's father was rounded up after betrayal and deported as a penitentiary case through Westerbork to Sobibor and killed there. Paul and his mother survived the war.
The day before this interview Paul was in the Dutch National Archives in The Hague and found out there who betrayed his father in 1943. The interview was mainly about this special finding. During the spring of 2011 Paul Hellmann found out more about the man who betrayed his father and the circumstances of the betrayal; he wrote a book about it, "Small Evil." He wrote "My Great Expectations" earlier. (Both in Dutch)
Paul Hellmann is married and has children. Before his retirement he worked as a journalist.
<###51618###>Citation Analysis and Grey Literature: Stakeholders in the Grey Circuit The goal of this research project is to learn more about the expanding field of information known as "grey literature". Citation analysis allows one the possibility to follow the work of the authors in the GL-Conference series, as well as authors whom they have cited both in grey and commercial publishing. A further goal of this paper is to examine the value of the GLConference Proceedings for research in the field of grey literature by examining among other things, its impact on the work of contributing authors. This study was sparked by a general interest in citation analysis as an instrument used in various sciences including information science. And, in particular by a paper presented at GL5 in which grey literature as a main channel for publication by an International Marine Scientific Advisory Body was investigated. (MacDonald [et al.], 2004). The stakeholders in this study are not first and foremost the authors who produce a document type, which falls within the category of grey literature. Instead this study is directed to those authors who focus their research and writing on the topic of grey literature, these could be referred to as the meta-authors on grey literature. They have entered the field of information studies and focused on a particular area, they entered in small numbers and in the past decade they have become contending stakeholders. In the first five volumes of the GL Conference Proceedings a total of 139 conference papers were published, 30 of which did not contain references. Bibliographic data shows that 152 authors/co-authors, which is a full sample, were responsible for the content of these papers. 108 are 1st authors, 78 of whom are sole authors. 30 of the authors (>20%) have published more than once in the conference series and of who 6 (>.05%) have published three or more times in this series. It is important that those authors who published within the series are also published outside the series – indicating that their clout extends beyond the grey circuit. In this way, their sphere of influence covers their entire work and reflects well on the conference series as a whole. The direction until now has been grey to commercially published e.g. a conference paper is later published as a journal article; however, with the advent of OAI, Open Archive Initiative, this direction could now even allow for reversal.
<###51615###>Grey Literature: A Pilot Course constructed and implemented via Distance Education Over the past years, training courses, guest lectures, seminars and workshops have been organized by information professionals on the topic of grey literature. Most of these endeavours have undoubtedly had some impact on this field of information, however difficult it would be to measure. Many of these course lectures were given within existing programs and may have only been one-time offerings. At the Eighth International Conference on Grey Literature (New Orleans, 2006), two of the authors in this pilot study participated in a roundtable on curriculum development and grey literature. For their part, it was more important to find a proper structure within which to further construct an accredited course than to simply provide an inventory of ad hoc training courses or workshops, which deal/dealt with grey literature. The intended structure would have to incorporate the expertise of a number of stakeholders in order to guarantee potential students course credit, access to courseware and resources, qualified instruction, etc. Early on, it became evident that these stakeholders need not be physically present within one particular academic institution, but could rather be brought together in a joint venture by way of distance education. This paper will focus on the stakeholders in the pilot program and the specialization of each, as well as the students who are profiled and the knowledge and skills from which they would benefit. Built into the pilot is the maintenance of an ongoing log that would capture the pilot courses' development and progress, facilitate a SWOT analysis, enable comparison with other distance education courses in the LIS (Library and Information Studies) sector, and ultimately substantiate this course offering beyond a pilot phase to academic institutions with degree programs in information and other related fields on undergraduate and graduate levels.
<###51624###>Thematische collectie - GreyNet Enhanced Publications Project Grey Literature is a field in Library and Information science that deals with the production, distribution, and access to multiple document types produced on all levels of government, academics, business, and organization in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body. The goal of the Grey Literature Network Service is to facilitate dialog, research, and communication between persons and organisations in the field of grey literature. 
In 2011 Grey Literature Network Service  presented a project on Enhanced Publications- EPP.  Data and publications from this project are accessible via  the DANS online archiving system EASY and the Open Grey Repository.

<###51619###>An Analysis of Current Grey Literature Document Typology This analysis is based on the classification of the systems GreyNet, OpenSIGLE, Czech ASEP, RIV and others. During the analysis of the lists of document types, we have discovered that these typologies contain, besides "real" document types (reports, theses, etc.) other aspects, such as events (arrangement, organization), types of events (conferences, speeches), producers (universities, institutes), processes (translations, output), content (political documents, legal texts), location (domestic, foreign), and format (e-texts, numeric data). However, this approach is not systematic. Therefore, we have decided to create a classification scheme for document types only, and classify other aspects into various groups in order to define them more precisely. The scheme will be processed in a text version as well as schematically in mind maps. We believe that identifying a specific typology for credible grey literature document types, particularly reports, conference proceedings, and government documents, will assist in the classification of grey literature in the fields of science, research, and education. On the other hand, grey literature also consists of various means of communication, such as telephone calls, meetings, e-mails, blogs, interviews, social networking tools, or discussions in Wiki. It is important to identify only credible document types and not use unverified information that may be unsuitable for scientific work. The aim of this analysis is therefore to create, define, and implement a current credible grey literature document typology, in order to open discussions in the grey literature community, leading to a means of collecting GL from reputable events and producers rather than relying on social networking tools or Wiki contributions. While the later types of sources can assist researchers, scientists, and teachers with their information-seeking pursuits, document of this nature needs to be evaluated on a regular basis.
<###51617###>Access to Grey Content: An Analysis of Grey Literature based on Citation and Survey Data, A Follow-up Study Grey literature, an area of interest to special librarians and information professionals, can be traced back a half-century. However, grey literature as a specialized field in information studies is less than a decade old. At GL'97 in Luxembourg, grey literature was redefined "as information produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishers (i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body)". The subject area was broadened and the need for continuing research and instruction pursued. The results of an online survey carried out in 2004 compared with survey results a decade prior indicate two changes: (1) a move to more specialization in the field of grey literature and (2) a move to more balance in activities related to research and teaching as compared with the processing and distribution of grey literature. It is not that the activities of processing and distribution are today of less concern, but technological advances and the Internet may have made them less labour intensive. The burden that grey literature poised to human resources and budgets appears to have been reduced enough that the benefits of the content of grey literature is discovered. And this discovery of a wealth of knowledge and information is the onset to further research and instruction in the field of grey literature. This research project is a follow-up or second part of a citation research. The first part was carried out last year and the results were presented in a conference paper at GL6 in New York. Citation analysis is a relatively objective quantitative method and must be carefully implemented (Moed, 2002). Thus, in an effort to expand the results of our initial analysis beyond the realm of the GL Conference Series, an Author Survey will also be implemented in this follow-up study. The empirical data gathered from the online questionnaire will be compared with the updated data from the Citation Database to which the citations in the GL6 Conference Proceedings will have been added. Comparative data from the comprehensive citation database (estimated 1650 records) and the data from the online author survey would then allow for a clearer demonstration of the impact of this research. Where only part of the impact of research is covered by citation analysis alone (Thelwall, 2002). This research will allow for tracking the life of a conference paper as well as the application and use of its content within and outside the grey circuit. Further gain would be a better profile of the GL authors, who are the source of GreyNet's knowledge and information base. This in turn could lead to the subsequent development of services that are in line with the needs of authors and researchers in the field of grey literature. For example, a citation style for grey literature, where special analysis of hyperlinked citations would provide an opportunity to address the problem of the disparity of web-based grey literature in the context of open archives.

<###52007###>Aanloop Molengat - Maritime archaeology and intermediate trade during the Thirty Years War In 1635 or shortly thereafter, a Dutch ship was laden with all sorts of materials and products, mostly metals, but also textiles from the booming wool industries in both Flanders and Holland, a shipment of leather and exotic ivory. It was a ship of considerable size (at least 300 last) and departed from the Dutch Republic at a time of profound troubles. The Eighty Years’ War between the Republic and Spain was far from settled. War at sea was unremitting and intensifying, with Dunkirk privateers an unruly menace to Dutch shipping. Spanish rule in the southern Low Countries was highly militarised, and constant campaigns were waged against it from the North. Central Europe was devastated by the Thirty Years’ War, which had entered a new phase through new alliances. The heavy and strategically valuable cargo of the Dutch ship was assembled from North and South, as well as from a range of places in central Europe. The ship departed for a destination that it never reached. It sank off the coast of Texel, where it was discovered 350 years later. 
From 1985 to 1999 the wreck site and finds were subject to archaeological research, producing information on the ship, its setting and historical context as well as on the production and distribution of the individual shipments in the cargo, and informing us about the structure of early modern industry and trade, operating despite and because of the war. The present study, initiated by Wilma Gijsbers in 2010 and supported by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE), the Maritime Archaeology Programme at the University of Southern Denmark (MAP-SDU) and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO; a one-year Odyssee grant), is the first to bring together all this evidence and evaluate it as a whole.
<###51299###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 08 Rob Wurms Rob Wurms was only a two-moths old baby at the time he went into hiding. With his parents he lived in Swammerdamstraat in Amsterdam. Both his parents had children from earlier marriages. Two of his half-sisters were killed in Sobibor together with their mother. Rob's parents perished in Auschwitz. A half-brother and many other relatives were also killed by the Nazis, in Auschwitz, Sobibor, and elsewhere.

Three of Rob's elder (half-)brothers survived the war in hiding. Rob knew about his family and relatives only from hearsay. His hiding parents later became his foster parents, whom he considered to be his natural parents: he just didn't know anything else. They were very active members of the reformed community. His foster mother died already in 1949, his foster father remarried in 1951. His new foster mother told him he was a foster child, and Jewish. His natural brothers grew up elsewhere, Rob got to know them little by little. When he was fifteen his foster father died, a good man who did a lot for others and whom Rob was fond of. The discrepancies between reformed life at home and the Jewish life of his other relatives provoked inner conflicts in him. Embarrasment and grief has played a major role in his life. He and his wife brought up their three children in the Jewish tradition. Rob has lived a fully liberal, Jewish life.
<###51319###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Interview 10 Rob (Robert) Cohen Rob Cohen grew up in Amsterdam as the son of small business people. He recalls a care-free childhood with lots of playing in the street. During the German occupation Rob managed to escape razzias twice. The first time was when in 1942 a construction site was rounded up and he hid under some dusters. Three months later his doorbell rang in the middle of the night and he escaped via the roof. The corner shop of his parents had both Jewish and non-Jewish customers, and thanks to this broad clientele it was not hard to find a hiding address. Nevertheless, at the instance of his parents Rob reported at the "Hollandse Schouwburg" voluntarily and was transported to Vught.
Hard labour and severe punishments were normal here. Westerbork and Auschwitz came next. Rob saw many horrors from close by: he acknowledged already soon that he should not enter into emotional bonds with his fellow inmates. The more isolated, the less vulnerable, and the more chance of surviving the horrors, he reasoned. In Januari 1945 Cohen was forced to participate in a death march, leading to, among other places, Gleiwitz and Dora. He had to walk by himself or was driven around in goods carriages. He was liberated by Americans in May 1945. Four years later he married Bep. They have a daughter and two grandchildren. Rob's parents and his brother were killed in Sobibor.
<###51548###>Thematic collection:  Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' - description and all interviews 'The Long Shadow of Sobibor' is an interview project representing a unique historical document. The collection comprises open interviews taken by Professor Selma Leydesdorff with 9 survivors of the Sobibor revolt (1943) and 22 next of kin to persons murdered in Sobibor. These unique testimonials are far more than stories about camp life alone.

Stories of lives
The interviews are the stories of whole lives, in which people tell about the world that died with their relatives in Sobibor, and how they managed to continue with their lives without their loved ones. They recollect what the murder of their dearest ones or relatives did to them. Often they lost one or both of their parents. Those who survived the revolt that took place in Sobibor on October 14, 1943, also go into their lives before and after the extermination camp in their stories.

Great loss
All interviewees bear the marks of Sobibor. Both next of kin and survivors have severely disturbed lives; they all had to build a new existence after the war. Sobibor stands for wounds that never heal and for a world in which the great killing is always present. By giving these interviews and telling the stories of their lives, next of kin and survivors contribute to a better understanding of what it means to have to cope with an enormous loss. Thanks to their outspokenness Sobibor has become better known to the public.

Motivation 
The trial of John (Iwan) Demjanjuk, the Ukraine-born camp guard who worked in the Sobibor extermination camp from March 26, 1943 till October 1, 1943, started November 30, 2009 in Munich, Germany. Co-plaintiffs played a major role during the trial.
A number of next of kin to people murdered in Sobibor joined camp survivors in requesting to be heard during the Demjanjuk trial. These so-called co-plaintiffs played an important role in the Munich courtroom, once more due to the fact that Jews who were deported to Sobibor extermination camp from the Netherlands left behind almost no testimonials, and only a few survived.
The co-plaintiffs were offered the opportunity to tell their own stories by Mrs Selma Leydesdorff. Many of them were ready to do so, resulting in this unique oral-history project. This way, many of the co-plaintiffs became story tellers. With this project Sobibor Foundation, having taken a lion's share in supporting the co-plaintiffs during the trial, hopes to strengthen them once more. By interviewing them they were given the opportunity to tell about their recollections in comfort and peace and to prepare for the trial. Furthermore, they contribute to the knowledge about Sobibor. Most interviews were held before, at the beginning and during the course of the trial.

Survivors
Apart from a large number of next of kin, Selma Leydesdorff also interviewed nine survivors of the revolt that took place on October 14, 1943. These are persons who as inmates did forced labour in the camp and narrowly escaped the killing machine in the course of the revolt. They either participated directly in organizing the revolt or were involved very closely. Their lives are marked by the war, Sobibor, and their aftermath as well.

In these interviews is talked about:

Jewish life
Which Jewish customs and traditions are referred to by the interviewees? Did they observe the Jewish holidays before the Second World War? Which role does their Jewishness play now? This section deals with Jewish life in the Netherlands and Poland.

Shtetl
Before the Second World War most Eastern European Jews lived in shtetls. The traditional shtetl, that typically Jewish community in which all or most residents were Jewish, didn't survive beyond the Shoah.
The Nazis used the Polish shtetl Izbica - where, among others, Thomas Blatt and the brothers Simkha and Philip Bialowitz were born - as a ghetto and transitory camp for Jews on their way to the extermination camps.

Life before the war
In this section interviewees recollect their lives before the Second World War. The large majority of them grew up in Jewish Amsterdam. They tell about their childhood, recalling more or less beautiful aspects of family life, the herring cart at the corner of the street, the much-practiced craft of diamond cutting, playing with other children, their first work experiences, and, now and again, their first acquaintances with anti-Semitism. In short, there is a diversity of stories.
Before WWII most Jews in Poland - as in other Eastern European countries - lived in shtetls, traditional Jewish communities. So did some of the Polish survivors who were interviewed. Three of them are from Izbica, a small village and shtetl in Eastern Poland. About 5,000 Jews lived here before the war.

Persecution
When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands persecution of Jews began: registration, segregation, robbery, and deportation. Many people have recollections of the yellow Star of David badge and the round-ups.

Life during the war
Daily life was becoming more and more difficult for Jews during the German occupation. Persecution gradually became more intrusive and more gruesome. People tried to carry on with their everyday lives as long as they could.

Expectations
Jews in the Netherlands must have sensed that life under German occupation was going to be hard and unpleasant for them. But what did they expect, what exactly did they think?

In hiding
Part of the interviewees survived the war in hiding. Members of this group were in hiding with a non-Jewish foster family in the Netherlands as a baby or infant. A number of those surviving Sobibor found a hiding place in Poland after the revolt.

Camps & ghettos
There were three transition camps and one SS concentration camp in the Netherlands during the German occupation. Interviewees recollect their experiences in Westerbork and Vught. Camp life in Germany and Poland is also discussed.

Camps
Apart from the major camps like Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau, Bergen-Belsen, and Sobibor, some 1,200 satellite camps existed in the German Reich, mostly factories. In those camps lived between tens and thousands of people.

Westerbork, Vught, Auschwitz, Sobibor, Bergen-Belsen, Minsk, Belarus, Death marches

Ghettos
After the invasion of Poland the Germans immediately to set up ghettos, Jewish quarters closed off hermetically from the surrounding towns. Jewish inhabitants of these towns and from elsewhere were forced to settle in the ghettos. The ghettos were declared Judenrein (free from Jews) within a couple of years, in most cases faster.

Liberation
Many interviewees are ambiguous about the liberation. They survived the war, but at what cost? Relatives and loved ones had been killed. Feelings of gratitude were mixed with feelings of mourning and loss.

Life after the war
How did it feel when many did not return after the war? Interviewees recollect how they resumed their lives, shaped by such huge losses.

Rebuilding lives
So many people, so many different lives. Each of the interviewees have their own way of coping with the enormous loss that bears the name of Sobibor.
For these interviewees, rebuilding a balanced life has often been hampered by their war experiences and losses. Sobibor is still haunting them and not just on the background.

Consequences of Sobibor
Interviewees lost loved ones and relatives in Sobibor. Here they talk freely about the role these losses still play in their lives. Survivors of the revolt experience the hell that was Sobibor on a day-to-day basis up to this day.
Some of these interviewees were war foster children, or, being somewhat older, by themselves in hiding or in the camps during the German occupation.
Another group of the interviewees were in Sobibor: these are the survivors, who escaped during the revolt of October 14, 1943. All of them bear the marks of the extermination camp that was Sobibor.

Demjanjuk trial
Next of kin to people killed in Sobibor, and survivors of the revolt played a major role as co-plaintiffs during the Demjanjuk trial.
The trial of Iwan (John) Demjanjuk took place in Munich from December 2009 till May 2011. On May 12, 2011, the German judge found Demjanjuk guilty of complicity in the murder of 28,060 Jews in the Sobibor extermination camp. Next of kin to people killed in Sobibor, and a number of survivors of the Sobibor revolt were directly involved in the trial as co-plaintiffs. In their testimonials, they go into their expectations and considerations regarding the trial.

2,000 testimonials

<###32953###>European Values Study, 1990 - EVS '90 This data collection is designed to enable cross-national comparison of values and beliefs in a wide variety of areas and to monitor changes in values and attitudes of mass publics in 14 European countries and the United States and Canada. Broad topics covered are work, the meaning and purpose of life, family life, and contemporary social issues. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of work, family, friends, leisure time, politics, and religion in their lives. They were also asked how satisfied they were with their present lives, whether they tended to persuade others close to them, whether they discussed political matters, and how they viewed society. Questions relating to work included what aspects were important to them in a job, the pride they took in their work, their satisfaction with the present job, and their views on owner/state/employee management of business. Respondents were asked about the groups and associations they belonged to and which ones they worked for voluntarily, the level of trust they had in most people, the groups they would not want as neighbours, their general state of health, and whether they felt they had free choice and control over their lives. A wide range of items was included on the meaning and purpose of life, such as respondents' views on the value of scientific advances, the demarcation of good and evil, and religious behaviour and beliefs. Respondents were queried about whether they shared the same attitudes toward religion, morality, politics, and sexual mores with their partner and parents, their views on marriage and divorce, qualities important for a child to learn, whether a child needs both parents to grow up happy, views on mothers working outside the home, views on abortion, and whether marriage is an outdated institution. Questions regarding political issues probed for respondents' opinions of various forms of political action and the likelihood of their taking an action, the most important aims for their countries, confidence in various civil and governmental institutions, and whether they felt divorce, abortion, suicide, cheating on taxes, lying, and other such actions were ever justified. Constructed variables: PLUS1 to PLUS53 are constructs for 1990 only, C90_1 to C90_51 are constructs which can be used to make comparisons with the same constructs in P0830 named C81_1 to C81_51. Topics of constructs: religiosity, church involvement, moral values, conservatism-progressiveness, confidence in institutions, intolerance, materialism-postmaterialism, political involvement, Bradburn's affect balance scale, marriage, family, abortion, education, work.

<###52008###>Transcription of the manuscripts containing the New Testament letter of Jude This is the data corresponding to the monograph by the depositor, titled The Epistle of Jude: Its Text and Transmission. 

This book treats the textual tradition of the Epistle of Jude. The nucleus of the study is an exhaustive critical apparatus presenting the evidence of 560 Greek MSS, including dozens of lectionaries. For the first time, all these MSS have been collated in a complete book of the NT. The complete collation has brought many new readings to light, some of which were only known through ancient versions, and previously known and important readings have gained additional support. An accompanying textual commentary explains the rationale behind the various text-critical decisions in over 100 passages. 

This dataset consists of the transcriptions of the aforementioned 560 manuscripts plus a listing of their provenance. The transcriptions have been converted by the contributors from a proprietary format into UNICODE with XML-like markup. There is also a graphical representation of the texts, in which the information is split in several layers and anchored to the character positions. In order to compute with this representation, it has also been modeled as a database, and an sql representation is provided that can be directly imported into a MySQL database. A document describing the workflow from source to derived files is included as well.
<###52142###>Evaluatie Verklaring omtrent gedrag Natuurlijke Personen - VOG NP (1281) The objective of the study is to provide a better understanding of the possibilities for optimizing the central issue of VOG NP, including the assessment of the applicant and the work procedures. The definition of the problem is threefold:
• How can the interested parties (the organisations that ask persons to submit a VOG NP) and the applicants be characterised?
• How satisfied are interested parties with the central assessment and issue of VOG NP?
• Which adjustments of the work procedures are necessary in order to optimize the centralissue of VOG NP?
<###52139###>Evaluatie Bevordering Integriteitsbeoordelingen door het Openbaar Bestuur - BIBOB (01.018 ) The 'Promotion of Integrity Reviews by the Public Administration' (Bevordering Integriteitsbeoordelingen door het Openbaar Bestuur, henceforth 'BIBOB') Act will go into effect on 1 June 2003. This act will enable administrative authorities to refuse - under strict conditions - permits, subsidies or government contracts if there is a serious danger that the applicant is planning to commit punishable offences with them. Those bodies can request advice from the BIBOB Bureau as to the degree of the danger.To facilitate an evaluation of the 'BIBOB' Act - which will take place three years after the act goes into effect - a zero-measurement has been conducted. The results of that study will offer comparison material for the evaluation three years later. In preparation for the zero-measurement, an evaluative framework was set up.The zero-measurement was conducted by means of a written survey of 732 administrative authorities. In addition, there was a meeting of experts in order to test and supplement the results.
<###52121###>Evaluatie opheffing bordeelverbod gemeentelijk beleid (1204 A) The central question of this study is: “What is the status of prostitution in the Netherlands regarding local authority policy, inspection, enforcement and compliance, and what are the results of the abolition of the general ban on brothels?”

The cylinder seals that we used reside in the collection of the NINO and have been acquired in the 1930s by Prof. Dr. De Liagre Böhl in Iraq. The digitization of five seals resulted in one hundred photos around each seal (3.6 degrees rotation) and a single photo of the impression of each seal. 
These photographs could be reused when developing (testing) other techniques and compare them with our results.
<###52199###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 01 Thomas Blatt Thomas Blatt grew up in the Polish village of Izbica, which was used by the Geman Nazis as a transit ghetto for Jews on their way to the extermination camps in Eastern Poland. He was sixteen years old when he arrived at Sobibor with his parents and his brother. All three were immediately sent to the gas chambers, but Thomas himself was selected for forced labour. He had to cut women's hair before they were driven into the gas chambers. Thus he recollects how Dutch women would ask the "hairdressers" not to cut their hair too short.
Thomas managed to survive in Sobibor for six months and was involved in the October 14, 1943 revolt. Until the end of the war he hid in Poland, which was by then afflicted by anti-Semitism. He returned to Sobibor in search of any remnants. After the war, during the 'fifties, Thomas Blatt emigrated to Israel, where he met his future wife, an American with whom he left for the United States. After remarriage and the divorce from his second wife he returned to Poland. He has children, grandchildren, and grand-grandchildren.
Thomas Blatt still visits his place of birth, Izbica, and the site of the Sobibor extermination camp every year. For a large part of his life he has been working to save Sobibor from oblivion. To this end, he has written several books about his war experiences and the Sobibor revolt. In the eighties he acted as a witness during the trial of the former SS man, Karl Frenzel, in the German city of Hagen. In this period he also had a four-hour interview with Karl Frenzel.
<###52201###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 02 Semion Rozenfeld (Semjon Rosenfeld, Semyon Rozenfeld) Semion Rozenfeld was born and grew up in Ternivka, a shtetl in Ukraine. He had two sisters, his father was a taylor. Semion graduates from secondary school before enlisting in the Soviet army at age eighteen. He was wounded during heavy fighting and was made POW by the German army. After a stay in a concentration camp in Minsk he was deported to Sobibor, where he was elected for forced labour. Semion took an active part in the revolt.
After the revolt he was in hiding in a den under the ground in Poland for some time. When the area where Semion had been hiding was liberated in the summer of 1944, he again joined the Red Army to fight with them. After the liberation he returned to his place of birth, Ternivka, but found no one of his relatives any more. When he learned that a brother of his father in the closeby town of Khoshchevato was still alive, he went there. He married his uncle's daughter, Yevgeniya, on January 15, 1946. The couple moved to Gayvoron, where they raised their two sons. They followed their children to Odessa in 1975 and emigrated to Israel in 1990. Semion commemorates the Sobibor revolt together with a handful of other survivors every five years.
<###52202###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 03 Simcha (Simha, Symcha, Simkha) Bialowitz Simcha Bialowitz (1912) grew up in the shtetl of Izbica, a small Jewish community in eastern Poland. The Bialowitz family was observant. Simcha attend the Polish school, which had a few Jewish teachers. In the morning he would be in school, in the afternoon he would work in the local pharmacy and drugstore. When the Germans invaded, Izbica changed into a transitory ghetto. His father was murdered in the graveyard of Izbica, his mother and sisters were gassed in Sobibor.
<Though the last part of this interview, a conversation with Lea Bialowitz, is not in the project, there is a transcription stiso_20100210_Bialowitz_Lea>
Simcha saw his mother and his two sisters when they arrived in the extermination camp. His sister tried to hand over a parcel, but Simcha refused to take it. He survived Sobibor together with his younger brother, Philip (whose interview is also on this website). During the interview Simcha discusses his stay in Sobibor in great detail. He recalls how Demjanjuk once stood up for him in the camp. His recollections are fragmented. After the war he married with Leah and together they emigrated to Israel.
<###52206###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 04 Selma (Saartje) Engel-Wijnberg Selma Engel was born Saartje Wijnberg on May 15, 1922, in Groningen. Her parents ran a kosher hotel in Zwolle during the crisis years. Being Jewish, Selma went into hiding during the German occupation. She was rounded up and deported to Sobibor as a penitentiary measure in April 1943. She lived in this extermination camp for six months, working in the sorting barracks and, sometimes, in the woods.

In Sobibor, Selma met Khaim Engel, a Pole and her future husband. Together they escaped on October 14, 1943 during the revolt. They hid for nine months in a barn not far from Khelm. They were not well received in the Netherlands after the war; Khaim even went into hiding for a while. They emigrated with their two young children via Israel to the United States. Although Khaim, in contrast to Selma, could not feel at home there, the two of them managed to build up a good life in the US. For a long time Selma was angry with the Dutch because she and her husband were treated so badly after the war.
<###52207###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 05 Alexsy Wajcen (Aleksej Waitsen) Alexsy Wajcen was born in the shtetl of Hodorov, a Jewish community not far from the town of Lvov in Ukraine. Horodov was part of Poland before the Second World War, but annexed by the Soviet Union after 1939. Alexsy was the oldest of five children. He served in the Soviet army from 1940 onwards and as a prisoner of war arrived in Sobibor, where he was selected for forced labour.
With the exception of one brother all other family members were killed by Ukrainian fascists during the war. Alexsy took part in the Sobibor revolt that was led by Alexander Pecherski and Leon Feldhendler. He fled and enrolled with the partisans. Later on he served in the Soviet army and continued to do so after the war as, among other things, a parachutist.
Alexsy Wajcen's recollections are confused and fragmentary. He says he didn't speak to anyone about Sobibor until well into the 'nineties, not even in private with his wife and children. It was forbidden to talk about Sobibor in the Soviet Union; anyone who did was punished severely.

<###52208###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 06 Philip Bialowitz The Nazi Germans used Izbica, the Polish village where Philip Bialowitz was born, as a transitory ghetto for Jews on their way to the destruction camps in Eastern Poland. In Izbica Philip Bialowitz survived a fire squad as a young boy. He was deported to Sobibor in 1943 and selected for forced labour upon arrival. Philip's elder brother, Simkha, took care of him wherever possible. Philip was involved in the revolt and was assigned by its leader as a messenger who had to draw the Germans' attention and bring them to a place where they could be killed.
After the revolt Philip, who was almost eighteen by then, managed to flee and to find a hiding place with a Polish family who hid him and his brother in a barn. He did not want to stay in Poland after the war because of anti-Semitism. He emigrated to the United States after having stayed in two refugee camps (for Displaced Persons) in Germany.
 
Philip feels obliged to keep the reality and horrors of Sobibor in remembrance. He often gives lectures and he told the story of his life in a book, "A Promise at Sobibor: A Jewish Boy’s Story of Revolt and Survival in Nazi-Occupied Poland."
<###52209###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 07 Esther Raab Esther Raab was born in Chelm (Poland). Having grown up in a middle-class Jewish family, she remembers a "comfortable" childhood. Her father had many non-Jewish clients, with whom he could get on well. One of them helped Esther and her brother hide from the Nazis during the last year of the war. Esther had worked in a number of labour camps before she arrived in Sobibor in December 1942.
In Sobibor, among other occupations, she sorted clothes and other possessions of victims. She knew in advance about the revolt and prepared by putting sand in her pockets, so as to be able to throw it into the guards' eyes if necessary; they would then rub their eyes, enabling Esther to stab them with a knife in their stomachs. She survived the war in hiding with peasants in a barn. Shortly after the war she married with a Jewish Pole, whom she knew already before from Chelm. Polish anti-Semitism made them decide to emigrate to the United States. They got two children, whom they brought up in accordance with Jewish tradition.
<###52210###>Project 'Long shadow of Sobibor' Survivors: Interview 08 Arkady Wajspapir (Arkadii Weisspapier) Arkady Wajspapir (Arkadii Weisspapier) was born in 1921 in the Ukrainian village of Bobrovyy Kut, then a Jewish community. He had an elder brother and a younger sister. The family lived together with the grandfather from his father's side - and his second wife plus a few relatives - in a house divided for the purpose. Arkady had had ten years of school when he enrolled in the Red Army in 1939. He was wounded, made POW (prisoner of war), and, in September 1943, deported to Sobibor, where he was selected for forced labour.
Arkady played an active part in the preparation of the revolt and during the revolt together with a fellow inmate killed an SS man and a Ukrainian guard with their own hands. After his escape from Sobibor he enrolled with the partisans. When the war was over Arkady took up his studies, got married, and started working as a technical engineer in various factories at several places in the Soviet Union. Upon retirement he and his wife moved to Kiev so as to live close to one of their sons. His wife died in 2004.

<###52108###>Screening on intimate partner violence (IPV): Two studies on the validity of an IPV screening instrument in patients in substance abuse treatment Many patients in substance abuse treatment have perpetrated and / or experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) in the past year. To date, there are no screeners available to identify these patients. We developed a 4 item screening device for this purpose, the Jellinek Inventory for assessing Partner Violence (J-IPV). To investigate the validity of the J-IPV, 2 independent studies were conducted including 97 and 99 participants, respectively. Psychometric properties of the J-IPV were determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratio’s by comparing J-IPV outcomes to outcomes on the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) (‘gold standard’). Results showed that the J-IPV possesses good psychometric properties to detect perpetrators and victims of any as well as severe IPV. We recommend administering the J-IPV to all patients entering substance abuse treatment; if IPV perpetrators and victims are identified, action can be taken to stop IPV perpetration and arrange help for victims.
<###52568###>Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey ( TRAILS ) T2 Clinical Cohort The overall objective of the study is to contribute to the understanding of the determinants of adolescents’ mental (ill-)health and social development during adolescence and young adulthood, as well as the mechanisms underlying the associations between determinants and these outcomes. A particular aim is to focus on the interplay between individual characteristics and environmental factors. In addition to this major objective, a number of participants investigate the course and determinants of somatic (ill-)health, covering topics such as overweight, lung disease, sports, physical activity, and more.

The clinical cohort follows children who contacted specialty mental health services before the age of 10 years.
It collects largely the same data at the same ages as the population cohort. Data collection of the clinical cohort began one assessment wave after the data collection of the population cohort.

<###52501###>Reactions to threatening health messages Background
Threatening health messages that focus on severity are popular, but frequently have no effect or even a counterproductive effect on behavior change. This paradox (i.e. wide application despite low effectiveness) may be partly explained by the intuitive appeal of threatening communication: it may be hard to predict the defensive reactions occurring in response to fear appeals. The researchers examine this hypothesis by using two studies by Brown and colleagues, which provide evidence that threatening health messages in the form of distressing imagery in anti-smoking and anti-alcohol campaigns cause defensive reactions. 

Methods
The researchers simulated both Brown et al. experiments, asking participants to estimate the reactions of the original study subjects to the threatening health information (n = 93). Afterwards, the researchers  presented the actual original study outcomes. One week later, the researchers  assessed whether this knowledge of the actual study outcomes helped participants to more successfully estimate the effectiveness of the threatening health information (n = 72). 
Respondents: University Students (18-29 years of age)

Results
Results showed that participants were initially convinced of the effectiveness of threatening health messages and were unable to anticipate the defensive reactions that in fact occurred. Furthermore, these estimates did not improve after participants had been explained the dynamics of threatening communication as well as what the effects of the threatening communication had been in reality. 

Conclusions
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the effectiveness of threatening health messages is intuitively appealing. What is more, providing empirical evidence against the use of threatening health messages has very little effect on this intuitive appeal.

<###51136###>European Patent Office Project Location Rijswijk Municipality of Rijswijk preliminary archaeological study a field survey conducted for inventory purposes (exploratory phase) February 2012 RAAP Archeologisch Adviesbureau undertook a preliminary archaeological study in the form of a field survey conducted for inventory purposes (exploratory phase) in relation to the soil interventions that would result from the proposed construction/reconstruction operations at the project location in the municipality of Rijswijk.

During the field survey a total of 60 boreholes were drilled distributed over rows at roughly 25 m intervals. The general structure of the subsurface at the project location is as follows, from top to bottom: a stratum exhibiting (anthropogenic) fill and disturbance; the original surface level (topsoil); Gantel deposits; peat; lagoon deposits; dune sand; and sand. North(-west) of the line between boreholes 20 and 32, the Gantel channel has cut its way down deeply into the underlying beach deposits and lagoon deposits, and no peat and/or dune sand was found within the boreholes here.

Layers with good archaeological prospects:

Iron Age and Roman period - Gantel deposits
The survey indicates that the project location harbours a possibly intact cultural landscape that was presumably conducive to habitation in the Roman period. Soil interventions extending to depths greater than about 1 m -NAP may reach the archaeological level and thus could constitute a threat.

Neolithic - dune deposits
The potential archaeological level of the dune landscape (Neolithic) has been encountered at about 4.2 and 4.4 m -NAP in a few isolated locations. No significantly developed dunes constituting an attractive location for habitation or use (agriculture) seem to have formed upon the naturally undulating lagoon or beach landscape. The probability of finding dunes in which remains of (largescale) settlement sites from the Neolithic period might be present should be adjusted downwards (to “low”) for the southern part of the project location (car park level), for the area with high-rise buildings and for the area north(-west) of the line between boreholes 20 and 32, within reach of the deeply incised Gantel channel. Dunes may well be present in the non-built-up parts of the project location, particularly underneath the tennis courts. The boring system used (rows of boreholes) does not provide enough certainty to conclusively rule out the presence of dunes here or to systematically map them. The “moderately high” probability of encountering (large-scale) settlement sites should be upheld here.
